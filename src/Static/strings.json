For example, if there are 10 Stats available, each has a 10% chance of being chosen.\r\n- No Artifact can have the same Stat as both a Primary Stat and a Substat, and cannot have multiple of the same Substat. As such, the number of Stats available decreases with each additional Substat an Artifact may have, and the chances of each Substat will subsequently increase.\r\n\r\n<color=#ffe87d>How Substat Charms work:</color>\r\n- Substat Charms increase the odds of getting a specific Substat. You will have a 50% chance of getting your desired Stat as the first Substat on your Artifact. This increased chance applies only to the first Substat.\r\n- The selected Substat may still be chosen as the Artifact's Primary Stat (if available for that Artifact), in which case it won't be available as a Substat.\r\n- The selected Substat will be excluded from the possible Substat options from any second, third, or fourth Substats the Artifact may have - even if not selected as the first Substat.","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/artifacts#title":"Artifact Type","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/artifact-type-weapon#title":"Weapon","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/artifact-type-helmet#title":"Helmet","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/artifact-type-shield#title":"Shield","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/artifact-type-gauntlets#title":"Gauntlets","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/artifact-type-chestplate#title":"Chestplate","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/artifact-type-boots#title":"Boots","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/artifact/stats#label":"Possible Primary Stats","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/artifact/odds-per-stat#label":"Odds per Stat","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/artifact/possible-stats#label":"Possible Substats","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/artifact/default-ods-per-stat#label":"Default odds per Substat (For first Substat only)","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/equipment#title":"Crafting Odds - Type","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/equipment/type#title":"Type","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/default-odds#title":"Default Odds","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/rarity#title":"Crafting Odds - Rarity","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/rarity/rarity-column#title":"Rarity","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/rarity/rare#label":"Rare","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/rarity/epic#label":"Epic","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/rarity/legendary#label":"Legendary","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/charmed-odds-column#title":"With Rarity Charm","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/stars#title":"Crafting Odds - Artifact Rank","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/common/chance#label":"Chance","l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/section/stars/rank-range#label":"Rank Range","l10n:battlefield/tower/tower-update#label":"Resets in:","l10n:heroes-selection/doom-tower/strategy#button":"Best Teams","l10n:prize/resource/tower-gold-key#name":"Gold Keys","l10n:prize/resource/tower-silver-key#name":"Silver Keys","l10n:auto-battle-reward/silver-keys-used#label":"Keys used:","l10n:lock-hero/doom-tower/secret-chamber/wrong-hero#label":"This Champion cannot be used in this Secret Room","l10n:heroes-selection/doom-tower/conditions#label":"Beat this Room using:","l10n:heroes-selection/doom-tower/not-satisfy-conditions#label":"Not enough Champions for this Secret Room","l10n:doom-tower-hud#title":"Doom Tower","l10n:doom-tower/hud/drop#button":"Reward Info","l10n:doom-tower/hud/rankings#button":"Rankings","l10n:doom-tower/map-item/locked#label":"Clear all lower Floors first to unlock this one","l10n:doom-tower/map-item/level#label":"{0}F","l10n:feature-unlock/doom-tower#label":"DOOM TOWER","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/secret-rooms#label":"Clear Secret Rooms","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/secret-rooms#description":"Complete optional challenge Rooms with special rules to win valuable loot.","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/stages-bosses#label":"Climb The Tower - Win Rewards","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/stages-bosses#description":"Clear 120 Floors and 12 tough Bosses on 2 brutal difficulties for amazing rewards.","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/rankings#label":"Top the Leaderboards","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/rankings#description":"Rush to the top of the Tower and claim your place amonst Raid's best summoners.","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/materials-craft-artifacts#label":"Hunt for Forge Materials","l10n:feature-unlock/unlock-info/doom-tower/materials-craft-artifacts#description":"Farm Boss Floors to get Forge Materials and craft exclusive Artifact Sets.","l10n:ban-reason-selection/confirmation-messages-box/confirmation/in-game#description":"Are you sure that you want to ban this player?

You’ll need to increase the durability of your Champions with <color=#1ee600>[Increase DEF]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Strengthen]</color>, and <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buffs. Or, if you can carefully control the number of hits you land, you can also time your Champions to use <color=#1ee600>[Block Damage]</color> or <color=#1ee600>[Unkillable]</color> buffs right when Vengeance comes out. \r\n\r\nThat timing will serve you twice-over, actually. Killing the <color=#ffe87d>Head of Wrath</color> while it’s under a <color=#1ee600>[Vengeance]</color> buff doubles the damage it deals to all other Heads, and has a chance of placing <color=#1ee600>[Leech]</color> debuff on them.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=hydra-?step=10#description":"<size=30><color=#FFE38B>Head of Decay</color></size>\r\n\r\nThe <color=#ffe87d>Head of Decay</color> will disrupt your healing and try to preserve other Heads by using a special buff: <color=#1ee600>[Life Barrier]</color>.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=hydra-?step=11#description":"The <color=#ffe87d>Head of Decay</color>’s third skill removes all debuffs from the most injured Head, then gives it a <color=#1ee600>[Life Barrier]</color> buff. <color=#1ee600>[Life Barrier]</color> works a bit like Shield, but it can’t be bypassed or stolen. If you break it before it runs out, the Head is Stunned for a turn. If not, the Head will be fully healed instead. \r\n\r\nBut the <color=#ffe87d>Head of Decay</color> gets its name from its passive most of all: every time your Champions are healed, it destroys the HP of the healed Champion - the amount destroyed is equal to 15% of the total value of the heal, so putting a huge heal on a Champion that was barely injured can destroy more HP than it recovers!","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=hydra-?step=12#description":"So, while the <color=#ffe87d>Head of Decay</color> is very annoying, it doesn’t actually have a good means of defending itself. It's very difficult to go completely without healing, so you’re better off decapitating the <color=#ffe87d>Head of Decay</color> as soon as possible. This also helps counteract some of the problem, since its decapitation effect heals your Champions a bit then restores 50% of the HP that its passive destroyed.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=hydra-?step=13#description":"<size=30><color=#FFE38B>Head of Suffering</color></size>\r\n\r\nThe <color=#ffe87d>Head of Suffering</color>'s main role is to protect other Heads, increase their Resistance, and decrease received damage. It is also eager to punish you if you neglect debuffs, as it brings the powerful <color=#1ee600>[Pain Link]</color> debuff to the field. \r\n\r\nAny Champions with a <color=#1ee600>[Pain Link]</color> will also receive 15% of the damage that the <color=#ffe87d>Head of Suffering</color> takes. The Head still takes full damage, but your Champions aren’t nearly as durable. You can easily end up defeating your own team. \r\n\r\nDespite everything, there are ways to beat this Head. To help survive, you can block the <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color> it puts out with its default attack by using the <color=#1ee600>[Strengthen]</color> buff.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=hydra-?step=14#description":"Or, you can cleanse it - you’ll want to be able to remove debuffs on your Champions anyway, to deal with the <color=#1ee600>[Pain Link]</color>. You’ll need high accuracy if you want to remove the Head’s <color=#1ee600>[Reflect Damage]</color> buff, but if you do it makes things easier for your damage-dealers. And while it’s nice that the Head’s decapitation effect gives you a <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buff, the real benefit is that the Head won’t be around to increase it’s ally’s Resistance and decrease your AoE damage.","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge-tab#button":"Rework","l10n:artifact/reforge-window#title":"Ore Storage","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/items-list-header#title":"Ore Storage","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/items-list-empty#label":"No Ore found.","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/items-list/select-item/notification#message":"Select the Ore you want to use to rework this piece of Gear.","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/items-list/max-durability/notification#message":"This piece of Gear cannot be reworked any more.","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/reroll#button":"Rework","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/items-list/inappropriate/notification#message":"You cannot use this Ore to rework this piece of Gear.","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/reroll/confirmation/notification#title":"ATTENTION","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/reroll/first-confirmation/notification#message":"Are you sure you want to rework this piece of Gear?","l10n:artifact-upgrade/reforge/reroll/second-confirmation/notification#message":"You're trying to rework a piece of Gear with Ore of a higher Rarity.

However, <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color> debuffs aren't removed from him when he's attacked - instead, he activates his <color=#1ee600>Slumber</color> counter for a certain number of turns whenever he is put to sleep. While that counter is active, the Sand Devil is vulnerable to many debuffs. Whenever the <color=#1ee600>Slumber</color> counter reaches 0 or the <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color> debuff on him expires, the Sand Devil will wake up. This counter decreases by 1 whenever Al-Naemeh receives damage (except damage from debuffs), meaning you can deal damage a certain number of times before you make the counter hit 0.¶","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=2#description":"Making the most of when the Sand Devil is asleep is important, as this is the only time you can apply debuffs (besides <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color>) to him thanks to his Passive skill, <color=#1ee600>Rest for the Wicked</color>. While asleep, Al-Naemeh loses his immunity to most debuffs, allowing you to place vital effects that’ll see you actually deal damage to him. This is doubly important, as each debuff placed on the Sand Devil reduces the innate damage reduction that <color=#1ee600>Rest for the Wicked</color> grants him. Keep in mind - Al-Naemeh is still immune to crowd control debuffs like <color=#1ee600>[Stun]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> or <color=#1ee600>[Fear]</color>, and he also becomes immune to <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color> for 1 turn after he wakes up. Naturally, you will want to bring Champions who can consistently apply <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color>, as well as those who can apply multiple debuffs in a single hit, as to maximize the hits left on the <color=#1ee600>Slumber</color> counter.¶","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=3#description":"His <color=#1ee600>Soul Sustenance</color> Passive is equally as dangerous, as it causes all of the Sand Devil’s attacks to destroy a flat 10% of your Champions’ MAX HP. If a Champion also tries to reduce Al-Naemeh’s Turn Meter, it’ll destroy that Champion’s MAX HP by the same percentage. Luckily, you can restore this destroyed MAX HP by healing your Champions while the Sand Devil is asleep, so bringing decent healers is essential to winning this fight.¶","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=4#description":"Al-Naemeh's first skill, <color=#1ee600>Rage of the Sands</color>, places a <color=#1ee600>[Decrease SPD]</color> and a <color=#1ee600>[Decrease ACC]</color> debuff on all Champions, reducing your ability to place the debuffs needed to conquer the Sand Devil. Therefore, you want to raise your Champions' Resistance stats to resist the <color=#1ee600>[Decrease ACC]</color> buff placed by the Boss, and also ensure you have high enough Accuracy so you can put the Sand Devil to sleep, and then apply the debuffs needed to reduce his innate damage reduction.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=5#description":"Applying multiple debuffs to the Sand Devil not only reduces his defense, but it blunts the power of his second skill, <color=#1ee600>Dune Tempest</color>. This skill cleanses Al-Naemeh of all debuffs, heals him proportional to the total amount of destroyed MAX HP on your team, and then attacks you. Stacking multiple debuffs is key to surviving this attack, as it deals less damage for every debuff that the Sand Devil removes from himself.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=6#description":"Finally, his third skill, <color=#1ee600>Feasting Swarm</color>, is devastating if you aren’t prepared for it. It completely ignores 100% of your Champions’ DEF, along with <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Block Damage]</color>, and <color=#1ee600>[Unkillable]</color> buffs. This skill will most likely wipe out your entire party, so bringing a Champion who can apply <color=#1ee600>[Revive on Death]</color> buffs will be key to surviving this hungering locust cloud. Al-Naemeh will go to sleep after using this skill, giving anyone who survived time to regroup.

HP Burn Champions like <color=#F3BC02>Ninja</color> and <color=#F3BC02>Walking Tomb Dreng</color> will be very efficient here.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-klyssus-?step=1#description":"Much like his Normal counterpart, Tainted Klyssus constantly revives his minions when his HP drops below a certain threshold. Old strategies still apply here; you can prevent his minions from reviving by using <color=#1ee600>[Block Revive]</color> debuffs.  Alternatively, you can keep the minions alive, place <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> debuffs on them and continually extend their duration. This will not only reduce their MAX HP, but deal consistent damage to Tainted Klyssus as well. If you don't have a HP Burn Champion, the Brimstone Blessing can be very useful. The <color=#1ee600>[Smite]</color> debuff it places will deal extra damage to Tainted Klyssus and his team.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-klyssus-?step=2#description":"To survive Tainted Klyssus's attacks, you'll need to protect your Champions. For this, you want to place <color=#1ee600>[Increase DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buffs on your Champions, and maybe consider equipping them with Bolster and Defiant Artifact Sets. Another must-have debuff is <color=#1ee600>[Decrease ATK]</color>. Tainted Klyssus hits hard, so you'll need to make his hits weaker in order to survive them.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-klyssus-?step=3#description":"And, of course, you'll want to make sure that you're dealing loads of damage to Tainted Klyssus and his minions – <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color> debuffs will help you with that.¶","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=0#description":"The Spider's Den on Normal Mode is one of the toughest Dungeons in Teleria, as it requires specific strategies to conquer. Tainted Skavag and her horde change these strategies completely, meaning those same tricks won't work here.\r\n\r\nTainted Skavag is immune to <color=#1ee600>[Decrease SPD]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Heal Reduction]</color>, and <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> debuffs, as well as Turn Meter reduction effects. In fact, <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> debuffs placed on the Tainted Spiderlings heal Tainted Skavag whenever they activate, so she's taking less damage from <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> ticks than you're used to.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=1#description":"However, don't despair just yet! There are key differences to help make the fight a little easier. The most valuable difference is that Tainted Skavag receives damage equal to 3% of her MAX HP whenever a Tainted Spiderling dies. Taking out the maximum of 10 Tainted Spiderlings in one go means Tainted Skavag loses 30% of her MAX HP instantly.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=2#description":"So, bringing Champions like <color=#E85CFC>Sinesha</color>, <color=#E85CFC>Skullcrown</color>, and <color=#F3BC02>Acrizia</color> with powerful AoE attacks will be vital. Maximize your damage output by placing <color=#1ee600>[Increase ATK]</color> or <color=#1ee600>[Increase C. DMG]</color> buffs on them.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=3#description":"You may not always be able to kill the Tainted Spiderlings in one shot, so protection is also important. To survive against Tainted Skavag and her clutch, you’ll want to place <color=#1ee600>[Increase DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buffs on your Champions. Consider your Artifact Set choices carefully too, as Bolster and Defiant will add extra survivability. Also make sure to boost your Champions’ Turn Meters (Tainted Skavag is very fast!), as well as to decrease the Turn Meters of the Tainted Spiderlings. \r\n\r\nTo help guarantee you take out all the Tainted Spiderlings in one fell swoop, place <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color> debuffs on them before unleashing the true power of your AoE nukers.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-hellrazor-?step=0#description":"Like on Normal Mode, the Dragon's Lair remains mechanically pretty simple. Once you overcome the initial waves and get to Tainted Hellrazor himself, you'll want to place <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color> debuffs on him, as well as <color=#1ee600>[Decrease ATK]</color> debuffs, since he hits really hard. Keep in mind that Tainted Hellrazor is immune to <color=#1ee600>[Decrease SPD]</color> debuffs and Turn Meter reduction effects. \r\n\r\nOne of the key differences between Hellrazor and Tainted Hellrazor is that the latter places twice as many <color=#1ee600>[Poison]</color> debuffs – and that becomes a real problem when Tainted Hellrazor uses his <color=#1ee600>Draconic Gaze</color> skill.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-hellrazor-?step=1#description":"<color=#1ee600>Draconic Gaze</color> completely empties your team's Turn Meters and unlocks the secret <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> skill for Tainted Hellrazor's next attack. <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> deals massive damage, and also places a team-wide <color=#1ee600>[Stun]</color> that can't be resisted. Effectively, it gives Tainted Hellrazor two attacks in a row and paralyzes your whole team. As if that weren't enough, <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> also instantly activates any <color=#1ee600>[Poison]</color> debuffs placed by Tainted Hellrazor.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-hellrazor-?step=2#description":"All hope is not lost though! Like on Normal Mode, when Tainted Hellrazor uses <color=#1ee600>Draconic Gaze</color>, a chunk of his HP bar will be marked purple. Deal that much damage before his next turn, and <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> will lock down again. Having strong nukers in your team is therefore a must. Also make sure to boost your Champions' Turn Meters to attack more often, but save your heavy hits for when they're really needed. \r\n\r\nIt's not enough to just deal damage; you've got to survive Tainted Hellrazor's attacks too. Placing <color=#1ee600>[Increase DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buffs on your Champions will help, as well as equipping them with Bolster and Defiant Artifacts Sets to mitigate the damage from Tainted Hellrazor's AoE attacks. Also, you'll need to bring a cleanser or <color=#1ee600>[Block Debuffs]</color> Champion to deal with the many debuffs placed by Tainted Hellrazor, or else you'll be in trouble.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=0#description":"Raiding the Fire Knight’s Castle can be tough at the best of times, but taking on Tainted Fyro will really put your skills to the test. Luckily, he can be overcome with the right Champions in your team!\r\n\r\nThe key is to fill your team with Champions who can hit multiple times in a single attack, preferably on their first skill so that it’s always available. This is the best way to ensure that you can break Tainted Fyro’s <color=#1ee600>Bloodflame Cloak</color> shield. <color=#1ee600>[Counterattack]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Reflect Damage]</color> buffs will also come in handy, as well as the Phantom Touch and Ward of the Fallen Blessings. This time though, Tainted Fyro will destroy an attacking Champion’s MAX HP by 1% every time they hit him while the shield is up. You’ll need to keep track of how much MAX HP you’ve lost, and the perfect time to restore it.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=1#description":"You'll also need powerful debuffs to defeat Tainted Fyro, but you can't apply them until his shield is broken. Once you've opened him up to attack, you'll want to place <color=#1ee600>[Heal Reduction]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color>, and <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> debuffs to deal plenty of damage. You'll also want to make sure that this hot-headed foe doesn't get a chance to raise his shield again. Placing <color=#1ee600>[Decrease SPD]</color> debuffs on him is a must, and you should also look to put out <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs. Tainted Fyro will instantly remove these <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs, but his Turn Meter will be decreased by 15% for each one removed, keeping him out of the fight and preventing him from raising his shield again.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=2#description":"One of the main differences between Fyro and Tainted Fyro is that all of Tainted Fyro’s attacks will destroy your Champion’s MAX HP. Champions like <color=#F3BC02>Marichka the Unbreakable</color>, or Blessings like Miracle Heal can help you restore that destroyed HP.","l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=3#description":"To defeat Tainted Fyro, you can use one of these two strategies depending on whether you have a fast team or a slower one. For the faster teams out there, you’ll want to start with boosting your own Turn Meter before placing multiple hits on Tainted Fyro to break his shield. From there, you can start placing <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs on Tainted Fyro to control the pace of the fight. Slower teams will have to rely more on the <color=#1ee600>[Counterattack]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Reflect Damage]</color> buffs mentioned earlier. After placing them, just wait for Tainted Fyro to attack and watch as your team’s counterattacks bring that shield down. After that, it’s back to Turn Meter control and placing <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs.\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to plan for the waves of Champions leading up to Tainted Fyro himself. For this, you will need Champions that use powerful AoE attacks and can control multiple enemies at once. The Brimstone Blessing will come in helpful here.¶","l10n:live-arena#title":"Live Arena","l10n:live-arena/battle-tab#button":"Battles","l10n:live-arena/battle-log-tab#button":"Battle Log","l10n:live-arena/leagues-tab#button":"Tiers","l10n:live-arena/leaderboard-tab#button":"Leaderboards","l10n:live-arena/opponent-search/finding-opponent/#label":"Finding opponent...","l10n:live-arena/opponent-search/opponent-found/#label":"Opponent found!
