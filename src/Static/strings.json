Gather the strongest each Faction has to offer, and set forth to battle.\r\n\r\n<b>SCROLL TO READ HOW FACTION WARS WILL WORK</b>\r\n\r\n- Each Faction will have their own dedicated location that they must liberate.\r\n- Only Champions from that Faction are able to fight for you at that location.\r\n- Each location will contain multiple Stages that your Champions must beat.\r\n- Each location will also contain tough new Bosses that develop and get harder as you progress.\r\n- Like Potion Keeps, each Faction's location will only be open on certain days.\r\n\r\n<b>What does this mean for you?\r\nPrepare. Train teams of Champions from each Faction and ready them for the wars to come.</b>\r\n\r\nHint: You'll need to rely on all your Champions.

    "l10n:forge/chances/info-overlay/sections/artifacts/how-to#description": "<color=#ffe87d>How Primary Stats and Substats are decided when crafting:</color>\r\n- Stats are random and decided in stages: First the Primary Stat is decided, then each Substat is decided one-by-one (depending on the Rarity of the Artifact and how many Substats it may have).\r\n- Each available Stat at any stage has equal odds of being chosen. For example, if there are 10 Stats available, each has a 10% chance of being chosen.\r\n- No Artifact can have the same Stat as both a Primary Stat and a Substat, and cannot have multiple of the same Substat. As such, the number of Stats available decreases with each additional Substat an Artifact may have, and the chances of each Substat will subsequently increase.\r\n\r\n<color=#ffe87d>How Substat Charms work:</color>\r\n- Substat Charms increase the odds of getting a specific Substat. You will have a 50% chance of getting your desired Stat as the first Substat on your Artifact. This increased chance applies only to the first Substat.\r\n- The selected Substat may still be chosen as the Artifact's Primary Stat (if available for that Artifact), in which case it won't be available as a Substat.\r\n- The selected Substat will be excluded from the possible Substat options from any second, third, or fourth Substats the Artifact may have - even if not selected as the first Substat.",

But survive the challenge, and the treasures within can make you powerful beyond measure.\r\n\r\nIn each Hydra Battle, you will fight against 4 Hydra Heads at once from a pool of 6, each with completely unique skills.

For Teleria's seasoned veterans, take on the Hydra on higher difficulties to get the most powerful rewards.\r\n\r\nThe Hydra is only available to Clan Members and unlocks at Level 45. You'll use Hydra Keys to Battle, and each player has a limited number of Keys per week. And once a Champion has been used in a Hydra fight, they can't be used again that week.

    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=1#description": "Al-Naemeh's main weakness is that he is susceptible to <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color> debuffs. However, <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color> debuffs aren't removed from him when he's attacked - instead, he activates his <color=#1ee600>Slumber</color> counter for a certain number of turns whenever he is put to sleep. While that counter is active, the Sand Devil is vulnerable to many debuffs. Whenever the <color=#1ee600>Slumber</color> counter reaches 0 or the <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color> debuff on him expires, the Sand Devil will wake up. This counter decreases by 1 whenever Al-Naemeh receives damage (except damage from debuffs), meaning you can deal damage a certain number of times before you make the counter hit 0.¶",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=2#description": "Making the most of when the Sand Devil is asleep is important, as this is the only time you can apply debuffs (besides <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color>) to him thanks to his Passive skill, <color=#1ee600>Rest for the Wicked</color>. While asleep, Al-Naemeh loses his immunity to most debuffs, allowing you to place vital effects that’ll see you actually deal damage to him. This is doubly important, as each debuff placed on the Sand Devil reduces the innate damage reduction that <color=#1ee600>Rest for the Wicked</color> grants him. Keep in mind - Al-Naemeh is still immune to crowd control debuffs like <color=#1ee600>[Stun]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> or <color=#1ee600>[Fear]</color>, and he also becomes immune to <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color> for 1 turn after he wakes up. Naturally, you will want to bring Champions who can consistently apply <color=#1ee600>[Sleep]</color>, as well as those who can apply multiple debuffs in a single hit, as to maximize the hits left on the <color=#1ee600>Slumber</color> counter.¶",

If a Champion also tries to reduce Al-Naemeh’s Turn Meter, it’ll destroy that Champion’s MAX HP by the same percentage. Luckily, you can restore this destroyed MAX HP by healing your Champions while the Sand Devil is asleep, so bringing decent healers is essential to winning this fight.¶",

Therefore, you want to raise your Champions' Resistance stats to resist the <color=#1ee600>[Decrease ACC]</color> buff placed by the Boss, and also ensure you have high enough Accuracy so you can put the Sand Devil to sleep, and then apply the debuffs needed to reduce his innate damage reduction.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=al-naemeh-the-sand-devil-?step=5#description": "Applying multiple debuffs to the Sand Devil not only reduces his defense, but it blunts the power of his second skill, <color=#1ee600>Dune Tempest</color>. This skill cleanses Al-Naemeh of all debuffs, heals him proportional to the total amount of destroyed MAX HP on your team, and then attacks you. Stacking multiple debuffs is key to surviving this attack, as it deals less damage for every debuff that the Sand Devil removes from himself.",

This skill will most likely wipe out your entire party, so bringing a Champion who can apply <color=#1ee600>[Revive on Death]</color> buffs will be key to surviving this hungering locust cloud. Al-Naemeh will go to sleep after using this skill, giving anyone who survived time to regroup. If you put him to sleep again while this skill is on cooldown, you’ll increase its current cooldown by 1 turn. So if you can keep putting Al-Naemeh to sleep, you can stave off this cruel attack long enough to put the Sand Devil to sleep for good.",

    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-klyssus-?step=0#description": "The key to defeating Tainted Klyssus and his minions is using <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> debuffs: not only do they deal increased damage to Tainted Klyssus, but they also destroy his minions' MAX HP. HP Burn Champions like <color=#F3BC02>Ninja</color> and <color=#F3BC02>Walking Tomb Dreng</color> will be very efficient here.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-klyssus-?step=1#description": "Much like his Normal counterpart, Tainted Klyssus constantly revives his minions when his HP drops below a certain threshold. Old strategies still apply here; you can prevent his minions from reviving by using <color=#1ee600>[Block Revive]</color> debuffs.  Alternatively, you can keep the minions alive, place <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> debuffs on them and continually extend their duration. This will not only reduce their MAX HP, but deal consistent damage to Tainted Klyssus as well. If you don't have a HP Burn Champion, the Brimstone Blessing can be very useful. The <color=#1ee600>[Smite]</color> debuff it places will deal extra damage to Tainted Klyssus and his team.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-klyssus-?step=2#description": "To survive Tainted Klyssus's attacks, you'll need to protect your Champions. For this, you want to place <color=#1ee600>[Increase DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buffs on your Champions, and maybe consider equipping them with Bolster and Defiant Artifact Sets. Another must-have debuff is <color=#1ee600>[Decrease ATK]</color>. Tainted Klyssus hits hard, so you'll need to make his hits weaker in order to survive them.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-klyssus-?step=3#description": "And, of course, you'll want to make sure that you're dealing loads of damage to Tainted Klyssus and his minions – <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color> debuffs will help you with that.¶",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=0#description": "The Spider's Den on Normal Mode is one of the toughest Dungeons in Teleria, as it requires specific strategies to conquer. Tainted Skavag and her horde change these strategies completely, meaning those same tricks won't work here.\r\n\r\nTainted Skavag is immune to <color=#1ee600>[Decrease SPD]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Heal Reduction]</color>, and <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> debuffs, as well as Turn Meter reduction effects. In fact, <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> debuffs placed on the Tainted Spiderlings heal Tainted Skavag whenever they activate, so she's taking less damage from <color=#1ee600>[HP Burn]</color> ticks than you're used to.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=1#description": "However, don't despair just yet! There are key differences to help make the fight a little easier. The most valuable difference is that Tainted Skavag receives damage equal to 3% of her MAX HP whenever a Tainted Spiderling dies. Taking out the maximum of 10 Tainted Spiderlings in one go means Tainted Skavag loses 30% of her MAX HP instantly.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=2#description": "So, bringing Champions like <color=#E85CFC>Sinesha</color>, <color=#E85CFC>Skullcrown</color>, and <color=#F3BC02>Acrizia</color> with powerful AoE attacks will be vital. Maximize your damage output by placing <color=#1ee600>[Increase ATK]</color> or <color=#1ee600>[Increase C. DMG]</color> buffs on them.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-skavag-?step=3#description": "You may not always be able to kill the Tainted Spiderlings in one shot, so protection is also important. To survive against Tainted Skavag and her clutch, you’ll want to place <color=#1ee600>[Increase DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buffs on your Champions. Consider your Artifact Set choices carefully too, as Bolster and Defiant will add extra survivability. Also make sure to boost your Champions’ Turn Meters (Tainted Skavag is very fast!), as well as to decrease the Turn Meters of the Tainted Spiderlings. \r\n\r\nTo help guarantee you take out all the Tainted Spiderlings in one fell swoop, place <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color> debuffs on them before unleashing the true power of your AoE nukers.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-hellrazor-?step=0#description": "Like on Normal Mode, the Dragon's Lair remains mechanically pretty simple. Once you overcome the initial waves and get to Tainted Hellrazor himself, you'll want to place <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color> debuffs on him, as well as <color=#1ee600>[Decrease ATK]</color> debuffs, since he hits really hard. Keep in mind that Tainted Hellrazor is immune to <color=#1ee600>[Decrease SPD]</color> debuffs and Turn Meter reduction effects. \r\n\r\nOne of the key differences between Hellrazor and Tainted Hellrazor is that the latter places twice as many <color=#1ee600>[Poison]</color> debuffs – and that becomes a real problem when Tainted Hellrazor uses his <color=#1ee600>Draconic Gaze</color> skill.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-hellrazor-?step=1#description": "<color=#1ee600>Draconic Gaze</color> completely empties your team's Turn Meters and unlocks the secret <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> skill for Tainted Hellrazor's next attack. <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> deals massive damage, and also places a team-wide <color=#1ee600>[Stun]</color> that can't be resisted. Effectively, it gives Tainted Hellrazor two attacks in a row and paralyzes your whole team. As if that weren't enough, <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> also instantly activates any <color=#1ee600>[Poison]</color> debuffs placed by Tainted Hellrazor.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-hellrazor-?step=2#description": "All hope is not lost though! Like on Normal Mode, when Tainted Hellrazor uses <color=#1ee600>Draconic Gaze</color>, a chunk of his HP bar will be marked purple. Deal that much damage before his next turn, and <color=#1ee600>Toxic Incineration</color> will lock down again. Having strong nukers in your team is therefore a must. Also make sure to boost your Champions' Turn Meters to attack more often, but save your heavy hits for when they're really needed. \r\n\r\nIt's not enough to just deal damage; you've got to survive Tainted Hellrazor's attacks too. Placing <color=#1ee600>[Increase DEF]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Shield]</color> buffs on your Champions will help, as well as equipping them with Bolster and Defiant Artifacts Sets to mitigate the damage from Tainted Hellrazor's AoE attacks. Also, you'll need to bring a cleanser or <color=#1ee600>[Block Debuffs]</color> Champion to deal with the many debuffs placed by Tainted Hellrazor, or else you'll be in trouble.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=0#description": "Raiding the Fire Knight’s Castle can be tough at the best of times, but taking on Tainted Fyro will really put your skills to the test. Luckily, he can be overcome with the right Champions in your team!\r\n\r\nThe key is to fill your team with Champions who can hit multiple times in a single attack, preferably on their first skill so that it’s always available. This is the best way to ensure that you can break Tainted Fyro’s <color=#1ee600>Bloodflame Cloak</color> shield. <color=#1ee600>[Counterattack]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Reflect Damage]</color> buffs will also come in handy, as well as the Phantom Touch and Ward of the Fallen Blessings. This time though, Tainted Fyro will destroy an attacking Champion’s MAX HP by 1% every time they hit him while the shield is up. You’ll need to keep track of how much MAX HP you’ve lost, and the perfect time to restore it.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=1#description": "You'll also need powerful debuffs to defeat Tainted Fyro, but you can't apply them until his shield is broken. Once you've opened him up to attack, you'll want to place <color=#1ee600>[Heal Reduction]</color>, <color=#1ee600>[Weaken]</color>, and <color=#1ee600>[Decrease DEF]</color> debuffs to deal plenty of damage. You'll also want to make sure that this hot-headed foe doesn't get a chance to raise his shield again. Placing <color=#1ee600>[Decrease SPD]</color> debuffs on him is a must, and you should also look to put out <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs. Tainted Fyro will instantly remove these <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs, but his Turn Meter will be decreased by 15% for each one removed, keeping him out of the fight and preventing him from raising his shield again.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=2#description": "One of the main differences between Fyro and Tainted Fyro is that all of Tainted Fyro’s attacks will destroy your Champion’s MAX HP. Champions like <color=#F3BC02>Marichka the Unbreakable</color>, or Blessings like Miracle Heal can help you restore that destroyed HP.",
    "l10n:boss-strategy/strategy/how-it-works/boss-name=tainted-fyro-?step=3#description": "To defeat Tainted Fyro, you can use one of these two strategies depending on whether you have a fast team or a slower one. For the faster teams out there, you’ll want to start with boosting your own Turn Meter before placing multiple hits on Tainted Fyro to break his shield. From there, you can start placing <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs on Tainted Fyro to control the pace of the fight. Slower teams will have to rely more on the <color=#1ee600>[Counterattack]</color> and <color=#1ee600>[Reflect Damage]</color> buffs mentioned earlier. After placing them, just wait for Tainted Fyro to attack and watch as your team’s counterattacks bring that shield down. After that, it’s back to Turn Meter control and placing <color=#1ee600>[Freeze]</color> debuffs.\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to plan for the waves of Champions leading up to Tainted Fyro himself. For this, you will need Champions that use powerful AoE attacks and can control multiple enemies at once. The Brimstone Blessing will come in helpful here.¶",

As a debuff, <color=#1ee600>[Enfeeble]</color> makes it so enemies only land Weak Hits, unless otherwise specified by their individual skills. He'll focus on disabling your Champion with the highest C.

Landing a Weak Hit increases the Phantom Shogun’s <color=#1ee600>Shade</color> counter by 8 stacks, with each individual stack raising his C. RATE by 1% and C. DMG by 2%, up to a maximum of 100% for both.¶",

If the <color=#1ee600>Shade</color> counter reaches over 30 stacks, Akumori will also completely ignore damage from skills or Masteries that scale based on his MAX HP.",

The Phantom Shogun will also automatically attack all enemies every time he kills a target.

    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=10#static": "Vergis’ life is one of service, a path he follows no matter the dark places it leads him. A ruthless commander of the Aravian armies currently fighting against the Kingdom of Kaerok, he has built his identity around service to the Aravian crown, and has cast aside anything that he considers to be a distraction to his duties.\r\n\r\nVergis’ original name was Aelmar and he was born to a noble High Elf family with connections through the Aravian court. His father was a senior officer in the Aravian army, while his mother had been childhood friends with Queen Eva herself. \r\n\r\nHigh station brought benefits to Aelmar in his early years, but it could not shield his family from ill fortune. His father was killed during a skirmish with Dark Elves near the borders of Durham Forest. Soon after his mother contracted festerlung, the disease leaving her weak and bedridden. With Aelmar not quite yet of age and the family’s finances rapidly dwindling, Aelmar’s mother appealed in desperation to Queen Eva.  \r\n\r\nEva responded by having royal doctors attend her and using her personal wealth to pay the family’s servants and annul the taxes normally due to the crown, ensuring that mother and son would want for nothing. Aelmar was given a junior rank in the Aravian officer corps. Though his mother could not be fully cured, the queen’s charity ensured she lived out her last years in as much comfort as possible, knowing her son now had a powerful benefactor.  \r\n\r\nAelmar never forgot Eva’s kindness, and as he progressed through the ranks, he became ever-more dedicated in his service to the crown. The queen watched his progress closely, a fact that was not lost on the young Elven warrior. As Aravia became more militarized on her order, he was given a senior command, and when war with Kaerok and the other Humans of Anhelt came, Aelmar did not hesitate for a second in following the queen’s orders, and would not brook any discussion about the dangers of the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe war did not go as the Aravians planned. As it became a brutal, protracted struggle, rumors began to spread of a disaster back home. Some even claimed that the queen had been corrupted, or killed.  \r\n\r\nAelmar flew into a rage at such accounts, informing his subordinates that anyone caught spreading falsehoods would be executed for treason. It was not enough to stop the stories, however. Aelmar became obsessed with countering them, and took the name ‘Vergis’ – a twisting of an Aravian dialect word for ‘truth’ – as he clung with increasing fanaticism to his loyalty to Eva.  \r\n\r\nVergis would likely have returned to Aravia to disprove the lies spread about the queen, but the war in Kaerok has gone from bad to worse. Vergis now leads the battle-hardened survivors of his many campaigns in an increasingly futile effort to subject Kaerok to Aravian rule, having proven his worth as a warrior many times over. At the Battle of Kellmarsh, he ran through a dozen Kaerok knights, one after another, with his piercing glaive. The defensive aegis provided by his gold and black plate armor and shield aided him anchor the center of a battle line against the fiercest of offensives. His zeal for serving his queen is such that he rarely tires in combat, ignoring wounds that might incapacitate others even as he calls upon his allies to fight harder and scorn the blows of the enemy. Despite the odds against him, some High Elves believe he may yet turn the tide in Kaerok, and win a victory for his beloved queen.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=70#static": "The Blind Seers are sightless prophets who have carved a nomadic life in Durham Forest doted upon by coteries of servants who still possess their natural sight and following the migratory paths of the arknells, small birds of prey associated with powers of foresight, and considered to be harbingers of portent. Hunting these birds is a feat of great skill, only achievable by those whose foresight is so honed that it has become akin to vision itself. The soothsayers use every part of the arknell in their rituals, wearing their purple feathers in elaborate headdresses and eating their entrails to induce intense visions. The sect believes that these visions are granted by the spirits of their forebears whose souls dwell in the arknells. By killing the arknell, Blind Seers believe they free the spirit and can then commune with them to receive visions. When a Blind Seer dies, every part of them is venerated and shared with the arknells, their blood drank, their flesh consumed, and their bones crafted into ritual blades, so they are kept in the cycle of memory and tradition forever.\r\n\r\nMany come to seek the wisdom of the Blind Seers and many are turned away. Most of the soothsayers do not covet gold or silver, silks or furs, but rather the betterment of the Dark Elf people. They see the greed and lust for power in so many their kin and despair, longing to point them on a path of compassion. Thus, only those who are deemed worthy are welcomed.\r\n\r\nFahari of the Blind Seers was abandoned as a child because she was blind, and was found by some of the sect’s servants and taught the ways and rites. Her skill at communing with the forebears was uncanny, and she soon ascended to a position of influence, counseling the elder on the leadership of the sect and directing the soothsayers’ servants.\r\n\r\nOne ritual Fahari took part in began as all did. She found and killed an arknell, and the petitioner came forward and asked their questions. When Fahari bit into the flesh of the arknell she knew immediately something was wrong. The stench of burning hides hit her first. The screams of the wounded and dying were next. When she opened her eyes, she was there. The tents of the Blind Seers were aflame, the screams were those of her sect. She knew the elder by his voice. He was pleading. He knelt before a fire as a shadow of an Elf flittered behind him. Fahari strained to see who slit his throat but saw only a silhouette wearing an arknell-feathered headdress. When she awoke from the vision she felt as if she had been punched in the gut. She knew she had to prevent the destruction of her group, the only family she had ever known. \r\n\r\nThe vision replayed in Fahari’s dreams. One of their own would betray their sect. Everyone became a suspect. As years wore on Fahari noticed that bone blades essential to the Blind Seers’ rites were disappearing, that those who came to beg for prophecy were increasingly not of pure heart and mind. The worm of greed was eating away at one of her fellow soothsayers, she was sure, but could trust no one bar the servants, those not privy to the rituals. They slipped between the tents of the Blind Seers, hearing and seeing much. It was from these spies that Fahari learned the elder’s secret.\r\n\r\nEvery week, strangers picked through the camp, past the guards and into the elder’s tent. One night, Fahari hid in the shadows outside and listened to their conversation. The elder and the stranger discussed the arknells, and who in the sect was willing to sell secrets. He talked openly of the Blind Seers’ ceremonies, of how the arknell was killed and how much flesh would induce visions. When the elder spoke of the bone knives the stranger asked how much it would be to buy. The price he named was high, but the stranger did not haggle. She heard the clink of gold and her rage was a white hot lance.\r\n\r\nFahari’s servants acted on her command after a month of careful planning. They set the tents of the named traitors aflame and killed any who moved against them. Fahari smelled the smoke from her vision, and tears streamed down her cheeks. She sought out the elder and found him. In front of all the remaining sect she held a knife at the his throat. His denials fell on deaf ears. She opened his neck with a defiant roar and the prophecy was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nNow, Fahari works to rebuild what had to be destroyed. She seeks the stolen secrets of her sect and hunts to reclaim their ceremonial blades, to rebuild their secrets, and punish the greed of those who would steal from the Blind Seers.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=90#static": "Deep in the uncharted thickets of Durham Forest gurgles one of the sourest swamplands in all Teleria. Dark Elves here scratch meager sustenance from the earth, their lives blighted by the poisonous mushrooms and flesh-eating fauna they’re forced to share their habitat with. Astralith was sold into this life with nothing but her name, her mother’s only gift, for her eyes were dark and glittered like the stars. She was an excellent harvester, squeezing her lithe frame into the sinkholes where the most bountiful crops were found. One day, delving into these depths, she lost her sure footing and fell into the unknown darkness, her head slamming against a rock. She was roused from her stupor by the shouts of another slave as they reluctantly dropped a rope. Such acts of compassion are rare among Dark Elves, but Astralith was a valuable worker.\r\n\r\nIt took hours for the injured Astralith to climb to safe ground, only to be met with disdain. In her unconscious state, the carnivorous plants in the darkness had attempted to digest her, leaving her face and neck burnt, bubbling, and hideous to look upon. Shunned from the worker’s camp, she was branded an ill-omen, becoming an example of what may happen should feet fail or hands slip.   \r\n\r\nHalf mad with hunger, she wandered the swamplands, unable to speak due to the burning of her throat. Other children were cruel when she approached, throwing stones and shouting insults at her. After one particularly brutal attack, Astralith responded. A blister of desperation burst within her, and she tore out their throats with the only tools she had, her nails and her teeth.   \r\n\r\nNews of the feral Dark Elf soon reached more 'civilized' areas of Durham Forest, its dark deeds becoming grander with each retelling, until the story reached the wooden spire of Bralvid the Collector. This Dark Elf master was known for his menagerie of strange beasts and he was fascinated by the stories of Astralith. Bralvid sent an assassin in his employ, Drolna, to capture the feral Dark Elf and bring her to serve in his house as a curiosity and guard dog. \r\n\r\nAstralith proved an easy quarry to catch. Food enticed her into the maw of Drolna’s trap. As the cage’s door slammed shut, her blood curdling scream stoked fear even in her captor’s heart. Drolna grinned. With her scarred visage and bestial movements, she was a perfect deterrent to any who sought to harm his master. But Astralith would not prove an easy monster to bring to heel. \r\n\r\nFor the longest time Drolna believed Astralith to be unbreakable. Slowly however, as she grew accustomed to hot meals and a warm bed of straw, she became malleable. Drolna taught her how to hold a blade, to weave magic into handheld bombs, to become one with the shadows. Astralith was his greatest triumph. Her ascension stoked his ego, for he had molded her from the mulch of the swamplands into a killer. Though there were things she never bent her mind to. She never learned to speak. Silence suited Astralith, her blades and the porcelain-white mask Drolna gave her that covered her burned face spoke louder than words ever could. \r\n\r\nIt was not long before Bralvid relied on his new pet for all his awful deeds, each mission more twisted than the last. Astralith burned houses, butchered bloodlines, and with every throat she slit she saw those who had mocked her in a previous life. She had power now, more power than she had ever wielded. That hunger which had once driven her to violence now drove her to insolence. She was an animal to Bralvid, petted when loyal and beaten when she blundered. Why should she chafe under the chains of an unkind master? \r\n\r\nBralvid saw this growing arrogance and in his desperation to assert dominance he made a fatal error. He ordered her to kill, as he had so many times, but this time the target was Drolna. The wily assassin had grown old and beyond use, Astralith was to dispose of him.\r\n\r\nHer blades whispered from their sheaths, a guttural howl forming in her ruined throat. She stalked Bralvid’s guards, tearing jugulars from throats in surges of hot blood. By the time she reached her cowering master, she was painted in the viscera of her enemies. Astralith did not strike the final blow. She simply opened the cages to Bralvid’s menagerie and they tore him to shreds.\r\n\r\nNow, Astralith grasps the reins of power, learning there is little Dark Elf masters fear more than a slave revolt. She has emerged as an unwitting figurehead for a quiet revolution, those who would replicate her actions wear her mask as though in solidarity. Enemies lurk in every shadow and Astralith remains resolute. She will not be stopped without a fight.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=130#static": "Every ruler and warlord of Teleria has their elite warriors. For the High Elves of Aravia, who already see themselves as Teleria’s finest, the expectations are perhaps higher than anywhere else. Their standard of excellence is the Royal Guard, who answer directly to the reigning Aravian monarch. Drawn from the military's best soldiers, they are master warriors trained in polearm-based defensive combat. Their first and foremost duty is to protect the monarch’s life, and those of the royal family, and beyond those duties they can be deployed at the King or Queen’s discretion. They are an effective means of projecting the monarch’s power and personal will, useful when courtly politics and factionalism bog down the royal agenda.\r\n\r\nRoyal Guard candidates have their backgrounds exhaustively researched and their psyches probed deeply. Ideal Guards are emotionally resilient, loyal, and driven. Many are drawn from the upper echelons of the Aravian army by referral, others are scouted by Aravian spies and recruited. The selection process and associated induction ceremonies are steeped in a thousand years of tradition, as are their traditional arms and armor. They wear impartial masks, to symbolize their renouncement of their past lives and former selves. Their coat of mail incorporates designs reminiscent of leaves, for the Elves’ natural purity, and scales, for the longevity and tenacity of Elvenkind.\r\n\r\nOnce inducted, Royal Guards serve for life. They adhere to strict schedules based on the movements and activities of the royals, while allowing for needful rest and periods of training. While martial excellence is the primary selection criterion, in their lives as Guards their skills often broaden to include various domestic duties, clerical tasks, and other courtly functions. Regardless of what duty they are seen to be performing, a Royal Guard is prepared at any moment to defend their liege. A monarch may converse in a relaxed way with a visitor, only for a wall of steel spears to coalesce around their royal personage at the slightest sign of danger or affront, as the Royal Guards nearby suddenly turn from silent onlookers into fierce guardians.\r\n\r\nOne Royal Guard known as Clerebon is lauded to this day as an archetype of the Guards’ fidelity and bravery. He served the royal family during the long and tumultuous War of the Elves, when families and loyalties were torn apart by the schism between the Elves who followed a dream of Darkness and freedom, and the Elves who stayed true to their ancient ways. Always a breeding ground for schemes and paranoia, the Aravian royal court was in a rolling boil of uncertainty and danger at this time, with Dark Elf agents and sympathizers constantly trying to enact a coup d’etat to end the war with a decapitation of the Aravian state. Clerebon was already a trusted veteran who had served for over six decades, and he was put in charge of safeguarding two of the royal heirs, a prince and princess who were fraternal twins. \r\n\r\nClerebon did not leave the royal twins’ side for days at a time, sleeping only for short intervals. He watched them at play and while they studied, their tutors and attendants scrutinized at all times by the hawk-eyed, silent, and stern-masked figure waiting always in the wings. His presence alone deterred many would-be assassins. One attempt, involving a venomous snake placed in the children's’ playroom, was thwarted when Clerebon grabbed the serpent by the head without hesitation and crushed it to death. It is said that the spirit of Aravia itself protected him from the serpent’s fangs, to repay him for his years of selfless service.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=160#static": "Rule of County Ralganos was in a succession crisis. The line of Raglin I was thought extinct, and numerous other dynasties were jockeying to claim the inheritance. A woman calling herself Raglin appeared, alone and already clad in the exquisite armor of a lord, before the burgomaster of a small town therein. She stunned him by producing documents dating back hundreds of years which proved she was the rightful heir of the whole county – found, she said, through simple good luck, a strong hunch, and persistent searching. Her documents were assessed by the wisest sages, and authenticated. Named Raglin II, she spoke little of her life before she discovered her inheritance, despite being in her middle age.\r\n\r\nThe matter was legally settled, but many nonetheless loudly questioned her legitimacy and continued to probe her purported history for inconsistencies. Others studied it out of academic curiosity. Either way, Raglin II’s ascent sparked a new wave of research into the historical Raglin I who lived in the Age of Hellfire long ago. In time, a few seekers of truth found strange and compelling overlaps between the two Raglins. Enough evidence built up for a wild theory to circulate: that Raglin II and her eponymous ancestor were, somehow, one and the same. \r\n\r\nThe Raglin I of old walked with the Arbiter herself in the years immediately after the founding of the Sacred Order. She was a key reason why the newborn Order and the Banner Lords, who at the time were merely the clans of Kaerok, became steadfast allies and strong cultural partners. Many voices at the time criticized the Arbiter’s decision to create a trans-national, multi-species organization with the authority to cross borders and wage war in the name of fighting Darkness. What guarantee of their own sovereignty could they expect? Who decided what threats the Order fought, and how, when those decisions could affect whole populations and the fate of nations? A liaison between the religious and the secular was needed, and Raglin I played that critical role. \r\n\r\nRaglin I was a kind and beloved ruler of the land that is now County Ralganos. She was quick to embrace the Sacred Order’s mission to spread the faith and protect the meek. Filled with compassion and empathy for the suffering of all living things, she learned novel, advanced healing magics newly developed by the Order’s priests. When the Sacred Order called for crusades, Raglin I went personally into battle at the head of her own armies, rescuing the wounded from the thick of the fighting and smiting the wicked. With her help the Order won many successful campaigns in and around Kaerok. She was keenly sensitive to the suffering of the common people that high-minded crusades and violence could wreak, and so she worked with community leaders to evacuate vulnerable populations and choose battlegrounds that would be less disruptive to locals’ lives. Meanwhile, any crusader who behaved like a common mercenary, demanding coin or lodging or wenches, faced swift chastisement from her. Raglin I’s example inspired others, and helped the bond of trust between Kaerok and the Order grow. \r\n\r\nBut at the height of Raglin I’s influence, she disappeared dramatically during a battle with the Undead. Eyewitnesses say she had been cut off, surrounded, and wounded unto death, but was rescued by the Arbiter, who appeared in a magnificent flash that temporarily drove back the skeletal horde. This miracle raised the flagging spirits of the living, who rallied and vanquished the army of the dead. The Arbiter is later said to have reappeared in the fastness of her Eternal Citadel, but Raglin I did not accompany her. Yet, the Arbiter assured her followers, Raglin I lived on, in a way that could not be explained in Telerian terms. When the time was right and the grand plan called for it, she would return. She became a martyr, honored by the Sacred Order and the Banner Lords alike. Raglin I’s children stoically bore her loss and did not question the divine. Her dynasty continued without her.\r\n\r\nThe Raglin II of the modern day is the same age as Raglin I was when she was taken by the Arbiter. Her armor’s hues and heraldry are a perfect match. Those who serve her gossip that the countess goes silent when her past is discussed, and has been conducting an exhaustive study of the last several centuries of Telerian history. Strange omens have been reported in the sky, comets and novae, signs associated with the Lightbringers of old that Raglin I once consorted with. Is she just a distant relative, as she claims? Is she a reincarnation? Or is she in fact Raglin I, washed up on the shores of time by the Arbiter’s inscrutable will, pretending to be her own descendant?",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=190#static": "Before Tayrel donned his mask and took up that name, he was a musician and a craftsman who was trained at arms and smithing, and forged his own spear and shield. As he moved them through the air, subtleties of his design and the flow of air across them made them resonate with hypnotic tones, sharp and droning and highly variable. For this his arms and armor were called his Singing Steel, and this was the kernel of his fame – enough to convince him to create a new persona.\r\n\r\nTo take a new identity behind a mask is a time-honored ploy to ascend in status in Aravia. The starkness of the masked visage is a statement of do-or-die commitment to absolute glory. A masquerading Elf is leaving everything behind to let their deeds speak as loudly as possible in the creation of a new mythos. Tayrel began his masquerade with a purge of Undead he had discovered gathering in the Mountains of Despair north of the Aravian heartland. Walking skeletons and frozen, mummified dead were being called forth by a vile necromancer called Periclor, himself riddled with frostbite, half-dead yet kept half-alive by his arts.\r\n\r\nBracing themselves against the frigid temperatures, Tayrel and a chosen band of allies raided the Undead warband in their valley. This served to provoke Periclor’s wrath. The necromancer marched his full might against the nearest Elven farms and ranches, located in the habitable foothills. This created just the dramatic crisis Tayrel intended to exploit, and when the local nobility demanded answers, he conveniently made himself and his forces available and shared what he knew, omitting his role in provoking Periclor. The nobles were in equal parts impressed and intimidated, charmed and disturbed, by Tayrel’s unsettling yet charismatic voice and the hypnotic sounds his Singing Steel made as he moved. They tasked him with subduing the menace and gave him command of more troops for the task. \r\n\r\nLeading his larger contingent, Tayrel met Periclor’s Undead army in an exposed, rocky valley swept clean of snow by constant downrushing winds, which nearly drowned out the echoing blows of battle. Tayrel’s troops held their own, but Tayrel himself sought and found glory with his Singing Steel. The Undead found that even their unnatural necromantic minds were disrupted by the eerie drones and whines of Tayrel’s spear as he slashed and stabbed their warriors to pieces. From near-mindless skeletons to Undead commanders of considerable intelligence, they all found it difficult to coordinate their assaults on him and follow through with their maneuvers.\r\n\r\nTayrel battled his way to Periclor himself. The strange drone of the Steel disrupted the necromancer’s concentration, and without that, all his death magic was for naught – the shivering necrotic wretch could not summon his death-magics, nor defend himself, against the whistle and whine of Tayrel’s spear. With Periclor defeated, Tayrel’s forces swiftly overwhelmed the remaining Undead, who reverted to mindlessness without a necromancer to guide them. The Elves suffered few casualties, leaving many mouths to speak of Tayrel’s exceptional and distinctive victory. Just as he had planned, he exploded in status, becoming a new and exciting mystery for the Aravian court… but one few wished to meet in person.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=200#static": "Since the earliest days of the Undead and the Age of Treachery, the Deathknight, it is said, was there. From the oldest fables and sagas of the heroes who battled the Undead menace, the Deathknight has lurked ever in the shadows. Perhaps he was the very first Undead ever to be touched by Siroth’s dark curse. Maybe he is nothing more than some anonymous, well-meaning person, seeking honor and dignity but finding death and horrid rebirth, and an eternity of servitude. But thanks to that very plainness, Deathknight is literally an icon. In him is reflected the faceless, universal threat of Undeath to all living things. His burning skeletal gaze and arrow-punctured armor is known across Teleria as a shorthand stand-in for all the manifold horrors of the Undead Hordes. Oaths and proverbs invoke him, sometimes seriously and sometimes with great irreverence. In many depictions he is given a humorous aspect, bits of black comedy added by artists and documentarians to cope with the terror. Commonly depicted alongside Deathknight is a pet rat called Nibbles, his only friend among the living or the dead. Spotting the duo in a mosaic or tapestry is a common pastime.\r\n\r\nIn every tale and tragedy, the Deathknight is the instrument of terror but never its mastermind. Tapestries and histories recording battle after battle against the Undead show Deathknight again and again, always amid the thronging skeletal legions of some vile prince of death but never at the vanguard. In this role as the everyman of doom, Deathknight is a figure of fear but also a humanization of the dead and a projection of sympathy for the cursed, and represents a complex psychological conflux for living minds. He is feared as they fear Death itself, for whether in Death or Undeath, all mortals must face their end. Yet they also know him as a constant companion, always sardonically looking over their shoulders. If Death is like a humble, overburdened workman, constantly visiting battles and cemeteries to carry out his labors, the Deathknight is his slightly less well-paid counterpart among the Undead. \r\n\r\nAs the Deathknight lore evolved over the centuries, the sympathetic bent in his depictions increased, as did the gallows humor. Slowly, as Telerians learned to cope with the ongoing presence of the Undead in the world, he became a sort of stand-in for the morbid curiosity of those who pondered – ‘what if I were an Undead? Could I keep my personality, my hopes and dreams? Could I be different from all the rest, and be something more than a mindless slave or a twisted schemer? Could there be an Undead out there who, like me, simply wants to do a good job, make friends, gain influence, hone his skills, and be respected?’ Even famed heroes such as Turvold and Galek were known to have this sort of ‘sympathy for the Deathknight.’ \r\n\r\nPerhaps it is only wishful thinking. Or perhaps a rare few Undead still have a vestige of free will, or even the capacity for good deeds. But could the common, ubiquitous Deathknight ever truly match the mythic status of the lords of Undeath? What would happen if an icon of lowliness was raised high? That is an altogether different question.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=240#static": "Some fifteen years before the great Gaellen War, in his prime years, Lugan was a minor Lord of Kaerok administering a poor, swampy, sparsely-peopled barony. Disease there was frequent and healers few and far between. Lugan himself had no great stock of learning, since his duties kept him busy and centers of knowledge were far removed from his dismal demesne. He had strength of arms, as every lord must, for all chivalry stems from martial prowess in Kaerok, but his most valuable trait was relentless drive and stubborn determination, wherefore he was called Lugan the Steadfast, a name he earned many times over.\r\n\r\nThough his advisors deemed it folly, Lugan led projects to slowly but surely drain the barony’s swamps, remove their stagnant waters – as he believed them to be a source of pestilence – and reclaim the land. He spared none of his modest treasury to hire expert engineers from afar. When peasants feared or resented the strange pumping machines Lugan imported, he came to work them in person. He spoke to his people and heard their concerns. Some feared for their livelihoods, having adapted to the bog as the source of their sustenance, and Lugan assuaged them. Thanks to no special boons besides persistence and careful planning, Lugan’s barony grew steadily in population, wealth, and infrastructure. Farmland spread across the drier lowlands, and increased productivity led to increased trade. This helped stimulate new services, and the construction of new roads and outposts. The growing populace yielded more recruits of fighting age, and the Kingdom of Kaerok finally looked to the barony as a significant contributor to the national levies.\r\n\r\nBy this time Baron Lugan was showing his age, but he had lived actively and well, and was little slowed in his tireless work. A fortunate thing, for the Gaellen War came to Anhelt and was soon to drown the land in blood and scorch it with spellfire. Lugan was awarded command of a significant fighting force. His soldiers were loyal to him not out of basic feudal fealty but from a genuine feeling of gratitude. They had seen how Lugan would not give up on their future, how he toiled long and hard alongside them to make it happen. Now, from his elite knights to his fresh conscripts, they were eager to fight and bleed for him. \r\n\r\nAs waves of Orcs, Ogryn, Lizardmen, and Skinwalkers landed all across southern Anhelt, Lugan’s forces were deployed to hold Yaervan’s Dike, a critical marching route across the boggy delta of Delanos. The logic of his military superiors was that his force had exceptional morale, and they were counting on the Steadfast to live up to his name. He and his troops fought long and hard against the Gaellens, but gradually were dislodged from the Dike and pushed deep into the bayou, caught between hostile armies and the unforgiving muck and mire.\r\n\r\nLugan the Steadfast led his brave forces through twenty-nine months of bitterly-contested survival. They never gave up probing the enemy lines for weaknesses, hoping for a chance to break free. They refused to allow the Gaellens to reduce the size of their pocket, pushed back against the guard units that kept them contained, and staked out a territory. They took pride in being a significant thorn in the Gaellens’ side in the region and a constant drain on their resources and manpower. \r\n\r\nRationing their food and water, and subsequently living off the land, Lugan’s forces starved and suffered. But many among them remembered tales from their parents and grandparents of the hardship that the barony had long endured when it was but a marshy backwater, and how their magnanimous baron had lifted them from such depths of impecunity and want. Knowing this, and knowing Lugan himself suffered alongside them and never hoarded for himself what could be shared with his soldiers, they bore up in stoic solidarity for month after month and season after season. Winters took their brutal toll, but it was during the second winter of their entrapment that they finally got their chance to break their encirclement. A blizzard of unusual intensity struck, and in the whiteout Lugan and the last of the survivors attempted to sneak through the dragnet around them. \r\n\r\nSadly, the record of their fate did not survive the ravages of the conflict. Certainly they were never noted again as an extant military entity. Most likely they died of exposure or were captured, but many swear that Lugan and the Steadfast Cohort, as it came to be called, escaped and even went on to fight in other battles.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=320#static": "Centuries ago, Gorgorab – along with his younger brother, Mortab – belonged to the brotherhood of the Mausoleum Mages. Keepers and practitioners of dark magical knowledge, the Mages served an ancient Human kingdom on the island of Tarnok, among the eastern Lost Isles. It was their duty – according to ancient custom and the prophetic calendar that guided the kingdom – to resurrect their dead rulers across an expanse of centuries, building an Undead dynasty that they believed was worthy of the Dragonkin Empire that Tarnok had sworn fealty to centuries before. Despite wielding necromantic arts, the Mausoleum Mages were forbidden from prolonging their own lives.\r\n\r\nGorgorab's temperament was ill suited to his priestly duties. Impatient and rebellious, he never truly accepted the right of the Undead rulers to command and control him, let alone in some perverse emulation of the Dragonkin Empire, which was, by then, long fallen.\r\n\r\nTogether with Mortab, Gorgorab stirred up unrest among the Mausoleum Mages, pointing out the injustice of their subjugation and recommending the only possible remedy – revolt. Those the brothers convinced to betray their oaths rose up and used their sorceries to unbind and destroy their liege-lords. Anarchy soon gripped the island of Tarnok with the collapse of the regime and, in the midst of this, the traitors, realizing they had lost control and unable to agree on any one course now that their rulers had been slain, made their escape from Tarnok’s blighted shores.\r\n\r\nThe Mausoleum Mages scattered across Teleria, most going their own way. After disagreements relating to the use of their magical powers, Mortab lost contact with Gorgorab, and later came to believe his brother had been slain by the surviving, living descendants of the old kings. He was mistaken, for Gorgorab had endured, concealing his identity as he traveled to Anhelt, intending to leave behind the legacy of the Mausoleum Mages and chart his own course toward immortality.\r\n\r\nLike the other Mausoleum Mages, Gorgorab embraced the unrestrained use of necromancy and flooded himself with its energies, unnaturally prolonging his life while bringing on the curse of lingering decay. After turning against his old rulers, he found himself ill suited to serving others, despite the fact that many Mausoleum Mages had slipped back into those same habits. Filled with ennui, he wandered far and wide, seeking purpose besides fighting back against the slow corruption of his body and the arrogance of those who he believed sought to control and use him. \r\n\r\nEventually, Gorgorab journeyed to the Stormwind Wastes, hoping to find the bones of the Dragonkin civilization that had supposedly once commanded the respect and veneration of his ancestors and raise them from death for his own gain. He wandered the region for many years, becoming a dire legend to those few mortals who encountered him on their travels and lived to tell the tale.\r\n\r\nGorgorab came across a ruined shrine that he identified as the tomb of a long-dead noble of the Dragonkin Empire. He attempted to resurrect the dusty remains but found it beyond his powers. Never one to give up lightly, Gorgorab established the ruins as his new home and ransacked its artifacts, including ancient stone tablets inscribed with spellcraft that the necromancer could not fully grasp. Believing the Dragonkin could further his knowledge and perhaps recompense his people for their misplaced fealty, he renewed his efforts to resurrect the noble, intending to force it to teach him how to achieve a degree of power that would ensure none would ever seek to use him as either servant or savant ever again.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=350#static": "Though the Sacred Order styles itself as the greatest bastion of order and justice in all Teleria, there are many who would disagree. For commoners especially, the members of the Order are not shining knights and saviors, but zealots and brutes. Membership is the preserve of the wealthy and the radical, neither of which have much of a history of compassion. Many are the hamlets and villages that have been ransacked by soldiers of the Order as they hunt for those they accuse of practicing forbidden magics, and many an honest and humble farmer has had his grain silos and winter stocks seized by knights looking to fuel their campaigns and crusades. There show little sympathy, and even less in the way of restitution.\r\n\r\nIt is no surprise, then, that some have sought to resist the Sacred Order, or even rebel against it. Among such rebels, the name of the Tomb Lord is held in reverence. While no one knows for certain where he came from, stories have it that he was once a crusading knight who, after witnessing one act of brutality too many, abandoned his vows. Some say his name came to him for slaying members of the Sacred Order who were desecrating an ancient tomb, while others say his title derives from his secret stronghold somewhere in the catacombs of Narbuk. Regardless of the reasoning, his supporters claim that the Tomb Lord is a freedom fighter, a vigilante, and a force for justice for the common man.\r\n\r\nBut these claims are half-truths at best. The Tomb Lord was indeed once a knight of Lumaya, but is now a member of a dark and secretive crusade. The Tomb Lord has always sought immortality and power, and has discovered that the Cult of K’Leth can provide both. It suits him to falsely pose as a hero of the people, claiming to be a minor nobleman who has been wronged by the Order, but who now wishes to force redress for the commoners. In doing so, he ensures lowly acolytes and new recruits to the cult revere him as their hero and freedom-fighter, while the higher echelons of the cult also make use of his false ideologies, posing the Knights Revenant as an alternative to the excesses of the likes of the Sacred Order. Wherever there is oppression or grievance, the Tomb Lord takes advantage, claiming to seek equality and serve the meritocracy of a cult that seeks to right wrongs and offer genuine advancement – even immortality – to everyone, regardless of their station.\r\n\r\nThis is a lie. Very few recruits have been known to have undergone the promised transmutation ritual, and the optimism that the Tomb Lord inspires helps fuel the misguided hopes of the downtrodden. To them, he is the vagabond knight, the savior of the lowly serf, a figure of resistance organizing shelter and relief for the suffering and leading raids against oppressors. For many of those who go on to join the Cult of K’Leth, he remains an inspiration and a symbol of all that is good and just about the Knights Revenant. \r\n\r\nThe Tomb Lord is never seen without his helm and armor for he knows that they have become a potent symbol, one that would lose much of its power if the face beneath were revealed, especially given how often that face – thanks to soul transmission – changes. In battle, the Tomb Lord inspires the acolytes fighting under him, but his efforts are not merely for show. In attack he shatters armor and bone with equal ease with his mace, while on the defensive his heavy plate mail and the strong sinews of the host bodies he favors ensure he can shrug off countless blows. That the Tomb Lord enjoys such a role meets the approval of many of the other Knights Revenant, all of them arrogant immortals who prefer to deal with their acolytes as little as possible. Whether the Tomb Lord enjoys this fantasy, or merely suffers it, is a truth known only to him.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=370#static": "The Black Knight straddles the line between myth and reality, an archetypal figure who has been part of the social fabric of Kaerok for generations. Such a span means that the current Black Knight is surely no longer the original person to bear that title, but a successor of some sort. Indeed, many see it as more a title and a role than a single individual. Elsewise, the Black Knight is unnaturally long-lived and perhaps something other than Human, but this a minority and controversial opinion. Whoever or whatever they are, they are anonymous and go about only in full plate harness and greathelm, concealing their appearance. The common folk hold that the Black Knight serves no master, perhaps not even the Goddess herself, but is some primordial wanderer, a being out of time, cursed with endless restlessness. \r\n\r\nTheir activities are best summarized by an ancient rhyme known to children across Kaerok: ‘Where wise and sane folk fear to tread / there goes the Black Knight in their stead / where stalk foul things of Dark and dread / there goes the Knight to make them dead.’ The Knight is a relentless foe of monsters and mutants, the nightmare Undead, the Knights Revenant, and all other forms of supernatural evil that dwell in the depths of Teleria. When all hope is lost and no strength can prevail, the Black Knight appears, striking down the terrors and shielding the weak from harm. When corruption festers unseen in some corner of the world or under the noses of the innocent, the Black Knight wades fearlessly into the foulest dens where it sneaks and crawls. When the Banner Lords are busy with their politicking, their wars of honor upon each other, their pageantry and pomp, and their squabbles with other nations, the Black Knight remains on constant vigil.\r\n\r\nOpinions among scholars and pundits differ as to what this strange crusader truly is. Some theorize he is a Lightbringer, one of the rare Firstborn of creation still extant in the modern age. Others believe this knighthood is an openly secret position that is filled as needed: behind closed doors the Lords gather and appoint a warrior to don the horned black armor and assume the role of full-time guardian of the people. If so, where do the Lords find candidates? The Knight’s indomitable stamina and skill at wielding his steel-clad warclub are certainly exceptional, so replacements would have to be drawn from the finest soldiers of Kaerok. Would any given Lord willingly part with their strongest fighter, to continue a tradition of a folk hero who scorns all wealth and fame and never reveals their face? Most deem it unlikely. \r\n\r\nTo explain the Black Knight’s battle prowess and seemingly everlasting nature, some have posited that their essence resides in the armor itself. When donned, they say, the strength and skill of the Black Knight fills the person wearing it, yet that person’s mind becomes dulled and desensitized, their free will submerged, their limbs numb and unfeeling, all controlled by the armor’s will. Thus the Knight can persist beyond old age and violent death, for as long as the armor endures, another may don it. Certain adherents of this theory also believe the replacement is chosen by the Banner Lords, who offer an unskilled peon as a sacrifice to whatever strange intelligence guides the magical armor whenever it is necessary to renew the Knight. Others say the Knight and the armor are unguided by any Lord or any worldly force known. \r\n\r\nFinally, there is the cynic’s point of view. The more sharply class-conscious among thinkers say the Black Knight represents everything the haughty knights of Kaerok claim to be, yet are not. They say that the Knight is mostly a comforting fantasy for those plagued every day by encroaching darkness, and that if the Lords truly cared, they would do more than send some lone vigilante to do their duty. Others say that is precisely the point of this enigmatic figure: to do the work too dangerous for any knight with name and standing to wish to be associated with, to plunge into the depths of evil lairs without fear of emerging tainted. One thing is certain, however: even the most cynical critic of the Black Knight, when faced with the slavering maw of some abyss-born horror, would gladly accept their aid.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=380#static": "In the more civilized corners of Teleria, ‘Baron’ is a title of nobility denoting influence and an honorable bloodline. But it is also the name of a man, one who was once a farm laborer of unknown ancestry, dwelling in a village that barely registered on most maps of its region.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, Baron was the sole ward of a drunken smallholder, and had worked crops and tended animals since early childhood. He had no idea who his true family was – a fact his adoptive father regularly reminded him of – which meant that he was destined to die either in obscurity, or at the hands of bandits who regularly raided his village.\r\n\r\nBaron’s day-to-day life was one of hard toil, but when word spread of a contest of martial skill in the village square, hosted by the mayor himself, the farmhand could not ignore it. When the day of the contest came, Baron waited for his adoptive father to fall into a drunken stupor, and he went to test his mettle.\r\n\r\nWooden swords clattered against oaken shields, gloved fists pounded into helmeted faces. Weapons were covered to prevent serious injury, but the dueling was vicious nonetheless. Baron's weapon of choice was a perfectly forged halberd, which he had found years before in a dusty corner of his adoptive father’s cellar. Many an evening, after that drunken man had passed out, Baron had taken out the halberd to practice fighting.\r\n\r\nTo his own surprise, Baron fought his way to the final duel of the contest, before which his opponent had bribed officials to arrange their starting positions so that the sun glared in Baron’s eyes. But years of toiling in fields in midday light allowed Baron to fight unfazed. After much feinting and parrying, his rival swung wildly, and missed. Baron brought his halberd down on his enemy’s shield and rent it asunder. All Baron had to do was knock his opponent off his feet to win the contest. At this point, as sudden as lightning, the spectators’ cheers turned to screams.\r\n\r\nBaron looked around. Bandits were attacking, and they cut down the mayor’s guards with ease. The villagers fled. Soon there was nothing but empty space between the mayor, who was frozen to the spot next to the ring in fear, and the interlopers – until Baron ripped the protective layer of his halberd and stepped in.\r\n\r\nThe bandits charged him. Baron charged back, running swifter than he ever had before into their midst. No matter how the bandits swung their maces or sliced with their knives, they only hit air. Yet somehow, Baron found his mark every time, as if he possessed some preternatural gift. Within minutes, Baron stood amid a pile of slaughtered bandits.\r\n\r\nWord spread of Baron’s deeds, such that he was soon invited to the nearby city of Arkantis to be thanked for his service to the crown. Expecting only an audience with minor kingdom officials, Baron was surprised to find himself in the company of several Banner Lords. They plied Baron with questions about his early years. They were especially interested to hear how a peasant came into possession of such a well-made halberd.\r\n\r\nBewildered and confused, Baron was later shunted from building to building and stranger to stranger until he found himself in the city’s archives. There, a wizened old man unfurled scrolls, opened tomes, studied Baron’s halberd, and revealed to Baron the provenance of his weapon. It had belonged to a Banner Lord whose family were slain by a band of Siroth’s minions. There was only one survivor, barely older than an infant. This matched Baron’s dim memories – he was that child, who made his way to the nearest village, dragging the halberd behind him like a toy. He remembered being hoisted off the streets by an intoxicated man who probably sensed an opportunity to get free labor. Only later did the man call him ‘Baron’, probably after news of the boy's family’s massacre reached the farm, Baron reasoned. In hindsight, Baron realized the man named him so out of a cruel sense of irony.\r\n\r\nNone of that matters now. Baron claimed his birthright: the Banner Lords inducted him into their ranks, his rags were replaced with a shining suit of armor, and an ornate helmet was placed upon his head. He came to wield his trusty halberd with great pride. It took some time for Baron to translate his amateur fighting skills into the finessed combat prowess the Banner Lords are famed for, yet he seemed instilled with an innate talent for combat, as if the blood within him carried some memory of his noble lineage. Before long, Baron was among the most exceptional and decorated Banner Lords to ever safeguard Kaerok from the minions of Siroth.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=410#static": "There was a time when Skartorsis was not one of the greatest necromancers of the modern age, but a mere destitute hedge-wizard, pedaling simple elixirs and petty spells to the gullible inhabitants of the peasant villages he passed through. That time is now long gone and, by the will of Skartorsis, will be forgotten by all but him.\r\n\r\nForgotten, also, will be the fact that on his wandering travels, Skartorsis discovered an ancient book of necromantic magics in a tomb he was using as shelter one night, during a raging storm. The wizard dared utter one of the incantations within, and accidentally unleashed a plague of the walking dead on the surrounding villages.\r\n\r\nMost minor necromancers lead short and miserable lives, soon becoming the victims of one of their own spells, a rival partitioner of the unholy arts, enraged villagers, or roving inquisitors. Skartorsis, however, was one of the lucky ones, or was being coached by an even higher, darker power. He was able to escape the clutches of the dead he had accidentally raised, then trap one and learn the correct spells to force it to obey. Becoming a puppetmaster appealed to one such as Skartorsis, who had spent his early life so downtrodden, and he found he had a natural aptitude for necromancy. It was not long before he was summoning the dead from further afield and setting them loose on unsuspecting hamlets to see what they would do. \r\n\r\nHis abilities did not go unnoticed for long, either by the forces of light or darkness. A witch hunter from the Church of Lumaya tracked him down and would have slain him were it not for the timely arrival of Necrotos, an infamous practitioner of black magic then operating in Anhelt. Skartorsis accepted the offer of an impromptu alliance, and together they slew the witch hunter. In the battle’s aftermath, Skartorsis agreed to become Necrotos’s apprentice.\r\n\r\nNecrotos mentored Skartorsis for many years, until he finally went a step too far. Skartorsis was able to seize the Crown of the Empty Tomb from the brow of an Undead ruler named Moresh. Necrotos demanded Skartorsis surrender the crown to him, which Skartorsis refused to do. A titanic battle ensued, a clash that rent the night and caused the dead to burrow up from their graves for leagues around. At the end, Skartorsis was triumphant.\r\n\r\nAs befitted a sorcerer who sought to cheat death, Skartorsis did not slay Necrotos or banish his soul. Instead, he beheaded him, and cast all manner of curses upon the flensed skull, forcing it to eternally gibber its secrets to Skartorsis, as well as acting as a locus for his own black magics. Between Necrotos’s skull and the Crown of the Empty Tomb, Skartorsis had all the tools he needed to become one of the most dread figures in Teleria.\r\n\r\nAll of these events passed centuries ago, and Skartorsis has lived up to his ambitions. The days of his meager existence as a mortal conjurer are long gone. Now, he is capable of raising entire armies of Undead minions, blasting foes with coruscating green death-energies, or causing them to age decades in the space of a heartbeat. Besides a legion of skeletal warriors, wayward spirits, poltergeists, and cruel shades have come to follow him wherever he treads. To those who know of him, it seems as though Skartorsis has mastered death, that he has transcended to a higher plane of reality. Certainly Skartorsis himself, secure in his arrogance and bolstered by Necrotos’s whisperings, believes as much. What he did not realize was that Necrotos was not wholly subservient to him - over time, the older necromancer hoped to reclaim both his body, and his control over his former apprentice.\r\n\r\nSkartorsis’s abilities are highly sought after by other Undead, and he is prized not only as a necromancer without equal, but also as an advisor and ally. On the battlefield, Skartorsis’ magics can be the undoing of the foe or the making of a friend. His abilities, aided by Necrotos’ unwilling, rasping chants and the focusing power of his crown, are more than a match for almost any sorcerous trickery his enemies might employ. Skartorsis demands a high price for any alliance, however, and even powerful vampires or skeletal warlords have found themselves kneeling in homage to the great necromancer. Some of the restless spirits and ghosts that perpetually surround him even whisper that Skartorsis seeks to one day become the greatest of all Undead, bringing every lost spirit and wandering soul together into one final, cataclysmic mortis-spell that will see him break the last shackles of existence and transcend into everlasting godhood. Perhaps this supposed ambition will come to fruition, or perhaps, ultimately, Necrotos’ supposed knowledge will lead his treacherous pupil to eventual destruction.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=440#static": "Sir Septimus is one of the wealthiest nobles in Kaerok. He is the Golden Knight, a friend to princes and paupers alike, the protector of the innocent, the upholder of the righteous, and the slayer of giants and monsters. He is the wielder of a holy broadsword of prodigious size and sharpness, gifted to him by no less a figure than a Lightbringer of Lumaya. Septimus makes all of these claims regularly. Most of his fellow knights and Banner Lords agree only with the first one – that Septimus is indeed one of the richest men in Kaerok. \r\n\r\nIf the knight himself is to be believed, he certainly did not start life that way. Born to a noble but impoverished family, Septimus inherited his father’s meager title and his old, battered suit of armor, neither of which were enough to live on, let alone bring the renown he craved. He embarked upon the life of a traveling hedge-knight, little more than a sellsword who wandered the lands on a nameless nag, lending his strength to those who could pay. He was at least blessed in one sense – he knew how to fight. He slowly accrued experience and reputation, which led to more work, and more money. Things really changed, however, when the terror known as Mudfoot the Big struck at the Free City of Delanos. \r\n\r\nWhether Mudfoot was unleashed by the forces of the Gaellen Pact, or simply waded to the prosperous port on its own volition is unknown, but what is certain is that the bellowing monster would have devastated much of Delanos had not a raggedy knight wielding a great, shining sword ridden forth to oppose it. The battle was long and fierce, but by the end of it – at least as Septimus tells the story – Mudfoot lay slain, Septimus standing astride the creature’s slumped shoulders, his broadsword buried to the hilt in the cross-eyed brute’s skull. Rumors that the clumsy monster fell and injured itself before Septimus finished it off are, of course, just that – rumors.\r\n\r\nThe people of Delanos rejoiced, and lavished praise on their savior. Even more importantly as far as Septimus was concerned, they also lavished money on him. For the first time in his life, Septimus could afford to eat well, bathe semi-regularly, and purchase new armor and a fine, white charger. He put his wealth to work by hiring a small retinue of men-at-arms to accompany him as he set out once more across Anhelt. Naming his band the Giantslayers, he made a very public oath that he would ride to the aid of all those who found themselves beset by monstrous terrors. \r\n\r\nThat particular avenue of employment proved profitable, for slaying large beasts naturally drew a great deal of attention and, with it, reward. Septimus’ retinue grew, allowing him to concentrate on the money, rather than the fighting. His wealth increased, helped by the fact that he was sure to pay traveling troubadours to spread stories of his famous exploits. He soon funded and led other expeditions, vanquishing everything from huge lizards to the hulking Ogryn king, Stegorax. Eventually, he used his funds to purchase a castle and land in Kaerok, cementing his own title by marrying into another noble bloodline.\r\n\r\nSeptimus has worked hard to establish himself as a member of Kaerok’s gentry. His giant-hunting days are now reserved for when the Banner Lords are called together for campaigns, though it is said he still makes a great deal of money from his old retinue, who continue to hire out their services as monster killers under the command of Septimus’ old right-hand man, Davo Two-Eyes. Indeed, how much of Septimus’s wealth is truly legitimate remains a point of debate. None can deny that the once-destitute sellsword has come good though, at least financially-speaking. \r\n\r\nWhen he rides to battle, Septimus makes a show of wearing gold-plated armor, the cost of which could probably feed every peasant in his fiefdom for the rest of their impoverished lives. He still wields the great broadsword which he first used to slay Mudfoot. There are strong claims that it is not a holy gift from a servant of Lumaya, as Septimus makes out, but a weapon forged by, and once belonging to, the chief blacksmith of Delanos, Mikael Strongstrike. According to Mikael, Septimus stole the blade in order to fight Mudfoot, and in the aftermath of his victory no one would listen to Mikael when he demanded its return. It seems the blacksmith has neither the funds to fight Septimus in the courts, nor the influence to recruit a band foolish enough to try to steal it back, for every mercenary in the west of Anhelt knows that if they cross Septimus, he has the wealth to ensure they are hunted to the ends of Teleria.",

Not long after Sinesha had come of age she was caught up in a carriage accident on the road from Arnoc to Delanos. Her injuries were slight and she suffered no lasting physical damage apart from a slight scar on her cheek. Despite its small size, the scar became the focus of her vanity, and she agonized over her belief that her beauty had been ruined. She began to search for a way to remove the scar and turned to dabbling in magic.\r\n\r\nSinesha was not a studious woman and had little understanding of the arcane. No matter what she tried, nothing worked, and what few sorceries she was able to attempt uniformly fizzled out. She slipped deeper into her obsession, convinced that her injury made her a figure of ridicule and refusing to be seen in public. Rumors spread among Kaerok’s elite that she was suffering some terrible sickness, or had committed a grievous crime and had secretly fled the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Cult of K’Leth have their spies everywhere, and it wasn’t long before stories of Sinesha’s strange circumstances reached the Knights Revenant. As a wealthy and seemingly reclusive woman, Sinesha was a prime target for the Cult. Lady Margeld, a fellow-noble and friend, was already a member, and encouraged Sinesha to join with claims that the Knights Revenant could help her.\r\n\r\nSinesha had little in the way of scruples and the Cult had no need to use their usual propaganda about the betterment of common folk to convince her to join. Instead, they persuaded her that a replacement could be found for her scarred body, one even more beautiful. All the Cult needed was her wealth, influence, and loyalty.\r\n\r\nShe provided the Cult with all this and more, pledging vast sums of silver to the Knights Revenant, as well as the use of her family’s summer manse on the edge of the Redspike Mountains. Sinesha quickly advanced herself within the Cult, discovering that it was not so dissimilar to the nobility of Kaerok, with its factions, pride, and desire for wealth and control. After some years she attained what she sought, and was gifted the body of a beautiful young maiden which she greedily claimed.\r\n\r\nSinesha planned to use the Cult’s dark magics to further enhance her stolen beauty, yet still she proved ill-suited to serious sorcery. But in her attempts – and through luck rather than skill – she made a discovery. Struggling to tap into ‘pure’ magic, Sinesha used the spirits within soul gems as a locus for both offensive and defensive spells. She leeched their energy to slow the onset of wounds, and their nascent anger to stir flame from blades. Overuse can shatter the gems, but there are always more, and Sinesha has never cared for others.\r\n\r\nSinesha now hunts down the fairest women in Teleria and lures them into the Cult with the secret intention of harvesting their bodies for herself. As long as she continues to prove her usefulness, she will have the bodies she craves.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=570#static": "The Oracles of Slumber are a Dark Elf sect that offer glimpses of the future, though their 'visions' often beg more questions than they answer. Rae was born into this cult and as a child, her visions were of things such as when lashing rains would fall or when a ravenous predator might attack. Rae's premonitions were different to the abstract 'knowledge' the Oracles possessed, hers were tangible and real. Rae had true foresight. The Oracles feared Rae’s gift would make them obsolete and several of their number claimed to 'see' that Rae was a danger to the entire cult.\r\n\r\nRae’s mother, Masarna, did not need foresight to see what the Oracles planned. With instincts alien to most Dark Elves, she stole her daughter away and ran deep into the wilderness of Durham Forest before the Oracles could strike. Masarna took nothing but the clothes on her back and her treasured bone knife, relying on Rae's foresight to guide the pair to safety. Eventually Rae’s dreams led them to a hut perched on a endless patch of twisting briars, far away from the reach of the Oracles. For years, they were safe. \r\n\r\nOn a day that began like any other, Masarna went to wake her daughter only to find Rae still deep in her dreams. Thinking Rae needed rest, Masarna left their hut to forage alone. When she returned, Rae was still sleeping, her blanket soaked with sweat. Masarna did what little she could but she was no healer. As dusk settled, her panic rose. Rae still slept. Masarna left her daughter to find help.\r\n\r\nAs Rae slept, she saw everything. Each step Masarna took was a thread weaving into a tapestry of certainty. Her path would lead to her death. In her dream, Rae screamed warning after warning to her mother, who could not hear her. Helplessly, she watched her mother enter the nearby canopy-town. She saw the flicker of robes, the notching of an arrow, her mother's eyes as her doom approached.\r\n\r\nWhen Rae’s eyes opened, she was alone in their hut. Grief swallowed her like a raging fire. She wished for nothing but for this to be a terrible dream. The pain nearly drove her to the brink of insanity. Frustration boiled under her skin, and no screams or tears could set her free from it. She smashed what little furniture they had, threw trinkets they’d collected over the years against the wall, and pummeled the ground with her fists. Still the rage at herself would not subside. She realized she was the reason they had fled from the Oracles, she was the reason her mother had left the safety of the hut, and so she was the reason her mother had been killed. Rae only halted when she found her mother’s knife. In the throws of her madness, an idea formed in her mind. Her visions were her enemy. She decided to do what she thought in her childlike mind would make it impossible for them to return. She clenched her stomach, raised the blade, and plunged it into her eye, intent on taking the next immediately after. \r\n\r\nBut the moment the knife’s point pierced her eye, Rae received a vision more powerful than she had ever had before. In it, she stood among frozen wastes which she knew, somehow instinctively, as the Winterlands, shuddering in the snowdrifts as towering mountains loomed above. Among flurries of snow were figures, shadows moving inexorably to an unknown destination. Before she could wipe the snow from her eyes, the vision faded. She lay on the floor of her hut, her hands sticky with blood. A longing overcame her. She had to go back there. She had to see more. She had to know if what she saw was real.\r\n\r\nRae left her life behind after blinding her eye, all thoughts of taking the other forgotten. She strode to the nearby canopy-town, finding the Oracle’s assassin dozing fitfully. In one clean movement, she sliced his eye open. To her complete surprise, the vision returned. The wasteland. The white mountains. The figures, a little closer. When the vision faded, the man lay dead before her. \r\n\r\nEver since that day, Rae has sought to uncover the mystery of her visions. She has sold her knowledge of the future, paid for tutelage in dark and ice magic with the funds, and slowly traveled northward. Still bitter from her life of suffering, she is a ruthless being, one whom would kill much sooner than talk. She is determined she will know the truth of the beings who walk through Winterlands snowstorms. It is the only purpose she has left.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=650#static": "Few Ogryn mercenaries are more highly prized than the Skullcrushers. Clad in heavy war-plates made from scrap iron and looted mail, and bearing heavy-bladed, barbed axes, they make for imposing opponents. In battle, they can be found acting as bodyguards for important commanders, or striding into the thick of the fighting as the tip of an indomitable counter-attack. \r\n\r\nThe origin of the Skullcrushers occurred during the War of the Elves. A few Ogryn mercenaries, tired of enduring the volleys from Aravian archers while serving the Dark Elves, crafted better armor for themselves out of scraps left on the battlefields. Prior to this, the Ogryn warriors had only borne crude war-plate, but with the addition of Aravian mail, their armor was better able to resist the enemy's arrows. Thus warded, they proved themselves to be a dangerous addition to the Dark Elves' forces. \r\n\r\nTheir employers found that a phalanx of Skullcrushers was almost an army in and of itself. They were all but unstoppable on the field, capable of smashing a gaping hole in even the strongest enemy battleline and enduring storms of arrows and crossbow bolts. The Skullcrushers also made indomitable bodyguards, willing and able to protect their charges against any foe, almost no matter how large or terrifying, due to their faith in the impregnability of their armor and the fear their reputation came to inspire. \r\n\r\nThis unshakable confidence ensured that Skullcrushers would fight on, even as their allies retreated, making them the perfect rearguard. The Ogryn took pride in their reputation for courage and immovability, and these led the ranks of the Skullcrushers to never depleted for long. Those who joined the group took to marking their helms with a smear of enemy blood, as proof of their ferocity. \r\n\r\nSelling their services to the highest bidder, the Skullcrushers have since fought on hundreds of battlefields across Anhelt, under the banners of the Free Cities, Aravia, and their old masters, the Dark Elves. They have even made their presence felt in the Lost Isles and parts of Peltas on occasion. \r\n\r\nRecently, the Ogryn known as Traguk Hammerjaw has assumed overall command of the Skullcrushers, after the death of their previous chieftain, Juk Snaptooth, at Lonely Marsh. Traguk is the very epitome of a Skullcrusher; stubborn to the point of obstinance and insanely violent. Larger than his fellows and fiercer by far, he is also cannier than many of his would-be employers expect of an Ogryn.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Skullcrushers can often determine the difference between victory and defeat, and Traguk has mastered the art of opportune renegotiation. He has learned that employers are often more than happy to double or even triple the Ogryn's pay to ensure that the fight goes their way. And if they are not, Traguk is perfectly willing to reposition his Skullcrushers away from the thick of the fighting. \r\n\r\nThis tactic has earned Traguk and the Skullcrushers the ire of more than one former employer. In one instance, at the Battle of Briarford, the Banner Lord of Kaerok who'd hired the Ogryn refused to give in to extortion and instead ordered elements of his forces to attack the mercenaries at the clash's height. What persuaded him to attack his own forces – albeit reluctant elements – is not known. Whatever the reason, Traguk's response was as swift as it was brutal. He led his warriors in a crushing counter-attack that all but gutted their former employer's forces and handed victory to the enemy… who quickly agreed to Traguk's subsequent demand for payment for services rendered.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=660#static": "Long before there was the Warlord, there was a small, sickly Orc child who brought shame to his clan. Having suffered through generations of ostracization and persecution, first from the Dragonkin Empire, and then by the Sacred Order, most Orcs now live at the fringes of society. As a result, an ideal many Orcs hold is that their shoulders must be broad, and their backs must be resolute, for the weight of generations past is great, and the tests they might face in life will be greater still. No such substance existed in the limp limbs and brittle bones of this particular Orc child, and so he was forbidden from training in the ways of combat as others in his clan did. Denied the opportunity to hone his body and blade, the child instead focused on sharpening his mind, studying the movements and patterns of his kin to build an imperious knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of how they fought. Though his expertise soon grew, he could not lift the spiked mace he had fashioned for himself with his scrawny arms, and so he continued to be the subject of intense ridicule from his clan. With much pain and trepidation, and the conviction that one day he would wield his weapon with pride, the young Orc set out into the world to find his own path. \r\n\r\nPerhaps it was his diminutive stature, or his less than intimidating presence, but this particular Orc was not feared in the way that many of his brethren were. Able to move more freely amongst the various peoples of Teleria as a result, the soon-to-be Warlord continued to grow his encyclopedic knowledge of combat strategy and techniques as he flitted from place to place. All that he needed was an opportunity to demonstrate the power of his wit and will, an opportunity that the whims of fate duly provided while he was encamped in a swamp. \r\n\r\nIt was an even and still day when the young Orc heard the Hearthcry, a particular Orcish song that signaled danger and called for help. Racing through the environment, which he had studied meticulously for the past month, he soon came to the source of the sound. Peering through the vines and thickets, he saw three Orcs surrounded and outnumbered by bandits. Quickly realizing that alone he would not be able to help his kin in a frontal assault, he set his mind to devising a plan. He drew upon his knowledge of the swamp, remembered a place he could use to his advantage, and then stepped out in full view of the bandits and taunted them. Immediately half the bandits set off after him, beginning a chase that was the first part of the devious Orc’s plan. Deftly navigating his way through the dense tendrils and mists, the young Orc led his pursuers into a series of sinkholes, where they quickly drowned. In the chaos and confusion, his fellow Orcs were able to overpower the remaining bandits. The young Orc returned to his kin, who welcomed him with open arms and invited him to join their clan. He was filled with pride.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to the other Orcs of the would-be Warlord’s new clan that their savior was filled with extraordinary potential. He was finally able to train and grow with his people, and soon he had the name that would follow him for a lifetime. Victory followed victory for the clan after he joined them, as his expert knowledge allied with his people’s strength built a formidable military power. With each triumph his reputation grew, as talk spread of the commander who was always one step ahead of the enemy, who could predict their every move, and manipulate them into going exactly where he wanted them to. The Warlord. It was a title many Orcs had earned, but never before had it become so synonymous with one warrior. Over the years, Warlord’s own strength grew too, as his body’s prowess finally caught up with that of his potent mind. Though never the size of some of the largest and most imposing of his species, his skill with his enormous mace was not to be underestimated, and those who did so paid a heavy price. From a small, sickly child who brought shame to his people, to a legendary hero, and perhaps one of the greatest leaders the Orcs have ever seen, Warlord stands alone in proving that all people can defy the path that is seemingly set out for them.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=910#static": "King Tayba assumed Kaerok’s throne during a troubled time, at a troubled age. His father was murdered by Dark Elven assassins, leaving the seventeen-year-old Tayba to don the crown and try to bring together a kingdom close to fracturing. While they had showed proper respect for king and kindred at court, the Banner Lords had spent the last century indulging in all manner of petty disputes, moving boundary stones, questioning bloodlines, throwing insults, brawling, and, again and again, the escalations would not stop until blood was spilled. Only one held himself above it all: Lord Champfort, the King’s Blade.\r\n\r\nLord Arohn von Champfort was not born to great influence, but was trusted enough to train and care for the young Prince Tayba up until the king’s death. Then, in his first act after being crowned, King Tayba made Lord Champfort his right hand: the King’s Blade, trusted with the king’s life and the peace of the realm.\r\n\r\nWithin a year of Tayba’s coronation, Lord Champfort had quelled six territorial disputes that had escalated to bloodshed. Barons, dukes, and viscounts had fought over woodlands, rivers, and mines, killing hundreds of peasant levies in pointless battles. Lord Champfort ended each conflict with the edge of his blade, and noble heads rolled in his wake.\r\n\r\nBut that was only part of Champfort’s duties. King Tayba had not forgotten the murder of his father. Everyone knew that Dark Elves were only mercenaries and King Tayba was convinced that a Banner Lord had paid for his father’s death, and he would not allow them to escape justice. A few years after assuming the throne, King Tayba called upon the Sacred Order to find the traitor. They sent a group of inquisitors, who became known as the Eyes of Kaerok.\r\n\r\nLord Champfort was the Eyes’ chief liaison with the crown. He searched for the traitor with vigor, without success, and as the years rolled into decades Lord Champfort met a new problem: the theft of his wits.\r\n\r\nLord Champfort was only in his fifties when he began to suffer from serious memory lapses and unpredictable bouts of confusion. As the symptoms worsened, terror gripped his heart, and so great was his desperation that he made the pilgrimage to the temples among the ruins of Narbuk. He prayed for an answer, a way to continue serving his King. His prayers were answered in the form of a cleric: a woman who could brew a potion that could stave off his madness.\r\n\r\nThe potion cleared away the clouds from Lord Champfort’s mind, even sharpened it… but only briefly. He needed regular doses. The cleric returned to Kaerok with him to produce more, and Lord Champfort became dependent on it and on its brewer. It was something he came to regret.\r\n\r\nChampfort otherwise returned to his duties. The Eyes of Kaerok suggested that the men responsible for the murder of King Tayba's father were slain during Lord Champfort’s purges, but King Tayba refused to believe it. Forced to continue the search, Lord Champfort found another use for the Eyes of Kaerok: the destruction of any who opposed the king. Nobles he accused were stripped of lands and titles, keeping the Eyes occupied and consolidating Lord Champfort’s power. But that power, once consolidated, could be leveraged by more than himself.\r\n\r\nAfter ten years, Lord Champfort stumbled upon a secret meeting between the cleric and a dark figure clad in blackened steel – a Knight Revenant. Lord Champfort reached for his blade, but the black-clad knight and the cleric only laughed. Without the Knights Revenant, there would be no more potions, they said. Lord Champfort would lose his mind in days. He would do as they asked, or he would go mad.\r\n\r\nChampfort could have wept from the strength of his fury, but his terror won out. Madness was too terrible for him to face. His heart heavy, Champfort did as they asked.\r\n\r\nThe Knights Revenant acted quickly. A potion of a different sort was brewed en-masse – a potion of complete mental domination. Champfort had it smuggled to the Eyes of Kaerok so the Knights Revenant could take control of them. These now puppet-judges quickly directed King Tayba’s vengeance to the Free City of Arnoc – war was clearly the Knights’ goal, but Lord Champfort could not understand why. Once King Tayba was convinced that Arnoc had plotted his father’s death, though, not even his daughter Valerie could stop the army’s march. Lord Champfort could do nothing at all.\r\n\r\nAnd so Champfort sat in Kaerok Castle, left to watch over an empty throne, standing side-by-side with guards who swore allegiance to Siroth instead of their king. He realized, far too late, that he should have died before betraying his realm. He should have died long ago.\r\n\r\nHe did not have to wait long before death came to him.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=920#static": "Life for Lizardmen in the Free City of Arnoc is either passable, or terrible. Fu-Shan arbitrates that line, and he decides which side of it nearly all his fellow Lizardmen live on. Thanks to his role as gatekeeper to a better life, Fu-Shan is one of the most powerful people in the entire city.\r\n\r\nArnoc’s Lizardmen live either in the sewers or in its ghetto. The ghetto has fresh air, access to the sky, and guards to police the streets. Lizardmen in the ghetto can rent a lot, build it up, assemble a workshop – as long as Arnoc’s guilds get their cut – and make a life for themselves. Non-Lizardmen cannot enter the ghetto without an escort, and the district is walled off from the outside, making it difficult to sneak in. A Lizardman living in the ghetto cannot be easily robbed and murdered by Humans or Elves – unless the would-be criminals have Fu-Shan’s permission, as he pays the guards. He also owns the land, and maintains the walls, the streets, and the relations with the rest of the city. Inside the ghetto, a Lizardman might have a future, but it means living and dying by Fu-Shan’s word alone.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is worse. The sewers beneath Arnoc are massive and overbuilt, with hundreds of extra tunnels dug around the proper sewer system – some say they connect to an old Dwarven settlement underneath the city, but cave-ins and spider infestations keep the curious near the surface, and none have ever delved deep enough to confirm the rumors. If a Lizardman clan can’t afford Fu-Shan’s prices to dwell on the surface – or don’t want to live in his shadow – they live here instead, scratching out a living as brute laborers for the city above. But they are far from free here, because Fu-Shan is not just a landlord, he is a gang lord.\r\n\r\nThe sewers are thick with a motley collection of criminals known as the Skinners, who assert control over and recruit from the sewer clans, extracting coin for ‘protection’ and making deals with topsiders for the labor that the sewer clans provide. If any clans 'struggle' with this arrangement, the Skinners punish them, sometimes even going so far as to live up to their name.\r\n\r\nControl over the sewer clans is hardly the extent of the Skinners’ ambitions, however. They also use the enormous space under the city to set up certain businesses far from the prying eyes of the topsiders, such as drug dens, gambling parlours, smuggling routes, thieves ‘guilds’, brothels, prisons, or whatever else there is demand for. All those businesses send a hefty cut to the one who makes it all possible: none other than Fu-Shan himself. If a topsider needs something 'sensitive' carried out, they know who to ask.\r\n\r\nAnd so Fu-Shan holds the ‘Free’ City of Arnoc by its feet – with the ghetto and the sewer clans, he controls the city’s cheap labor force. With the Skinners' operations, he controls the underworld markets. The guilds say they manage Arnoc’s economy, the city militia say they manage Arnoc’s security, and the council says they manage Arnoc’s laws, but should Fu-Shan make a 'humble request', he is quietly obeyed. Whenever these orders sit down to meet, each of them keep an empty chair at the table. Nobody ever sits in it, but everyone knows who it is for.\r\n\r\nAt least, that is how things once were. King Tayba of Kaerok’s war changed everything. When the Banner Lords broke centuries of mutual defense treaties to storm the gates of Arnoc, chaos engulfed the city. Soldiers, peasant levies, and mercenaries roved through the streets, killing and stealing everything in sight. But they left the sewers alone – not because they feared the reputation of any gang, but because of the stench. Fu-Shan, having lorded over the sewer clans for decades, was forced to huddle down among them, as terrified of discovery by the rampaging army as the lowest of his slaves.\r\n\r\nLater Fu-Shan realized that the sewers were no sanctuary, either. For many years, the Cult of the Skullsworn – a pack of ancestor-worshippers that Fu-Shan had always dismissed as fools and madmen – had been cultivating their numbers. With the city burning and the old powers crippled, the Skullsworn seized the opportunity to rise up and protect the Lizardmen. They seized huge swathes of the Skinners’ territory and killed hundreds of the criminals in a lightning war.\r\n\r\nHis forces backed into their few remaining strongholds and his grand web of influence torched to ash above him, Fu-Shan lurked in his hideout, waiting for opportunity to give him an opening at his enemies… or for them to finally bring the hammer down, and end his reign for good.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=930#static": "Today, Narbuk is a blight on the map. The ash and rotting timbers of the city that once stood there are long gone, but among the rubble and ruin that remains are a few scattered shrines and temples – the only things that the Sacred Order permits to exist on this once-holy ground.\r\n\r\nCenturies ago, during the Age of Hellfire, Narbuk was the birthplace of the Church of Lumaya. The Church’s promises of abstract blessings and absolution were not enough for some, and the greedy formed the Bone Temple.\r\n\r\nThe Bone Temple worshiped the bones of saints. They believed that these relics could imbue blessings and holy magic upon those who held them – and they were right, but only because their practice was not holy at all. The Bone Temple was a necromantic cult.\r\n\r\nMost did not realize it, but at least two men knew better: a corrupt Sacred Order inquisitor named Losan K’Leth, and a high-ranking Lumayan cleric named Usol Ma’Shalled. They were rivals for control of the Bone Temple – K’Leth concealed their true rituals from the eyes of the authorities, while Ma’Shalled was the chosen leader of the cult. The two clashed right up until the cult was discovered during the Sacred Order's Red Crusade.\r\n\r\nCrusaders hunting Orcs, Ogryn, and Skinwalkers arrived in the city, and their interrogations uncovered some of the lesser members of the Bone Temple and piqued the deadly curiosity of the inquisitors. The High Cleric of Narbuk was terrified that the sect would be discovered – many members were influential in the Church, and the High Cleric feared that the Temple’s fall would crumble the Church as well. And so the High Cleric approached Ma’Shalled and K'Leth with an offer: accept exile, and have the Temple flee in silence. Ma’Shalled refused… but K’Leth accepted.\r\n\r\nThe highest ranking members of the Bone Temple escaped the city, but the Sacred Order had already found too much evidence of it. A scapegoat was needed. And so K’Leth orchestrated Ma’Shalled’s death, hoping to pin all the blame on him.\r\n\r\nBut K’Leth was foiled, in part. Ma’Shalled had lived a life for himself, a life of greed, opulence, and power, all at the expense of others. When the assassin’s blade plunged into Ma’Shalled’s heart, Siroth’s voice reached out to him between his final heartbeats and asked just how much Ma’Shalled would be willing to take from the world to survive. Would he kill, just to live another day? Every day? Forever?\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed by his rage at K’Leth’s betrayal and desperate not to pay for the sins of his life, Ma’Shalled said yes. And so, in that instant of his death, Ma’Shalled became a vampire, bound by Siroth’s magic to drink the blood of the living to survive.\r\n\r\nMa’Shalled’s first victim was the assassin sent to kill him, but it would not be his last. For months, Ma’Shalled prowled the streets of Narbuk, feasting on any who stood in his way. Any other year, he would have been found and stopped, but in the dark days of the Red Crusade a few more deaths among the city’s poor were barely worth a shrug to the city guard. Not, however, to the canny Losan K’Leth.\r\n\r\nK’Leth had managed to pin the blame for the Bone Temple on Ma’Shalled even without a body to hand over, but he remained terrified that the temple’s former master was still out there. When he heard of the murders among the poor, he investigated in person. Ma’Shalled was thrilled when he discovered this, and he stalked his old rival for days before finally closing in for the kill.\r\n\r\nBut Ma’Shalled had been tricked, this time by Siroth himself. For, while a vampire might look and sound alive, they are, in truth, Undead, and no Undead can resist the will of a powerful necromancer. When Ma’Shalled lunged for K’Leth’s throat, K’Leth responded with a spell of domination. He took control of Ma’Shalled’s corrupted soul, turning the vampire into an obedient servant.\r\n\r\nAnd so Ma’Shalled became the greatest protector of the Bone Temple, then later the Knights Revenant. When the Sacred Order tried to destroy the Knights Revenant by burning Narbuk to the ground, it was Ma’Shalled who protected the cult's necropolis beneath the city from intrusion. K’Leth kept Ma’Shalled intact and sane through regular feeding, but, with Narbuk destroyed, importing victims became inconvenient. So he stopped. Deprived of blood, Ma’Shalled was twisted into a horrifying monster, hungry beyond measure and absolutely mad.\r\n\r\nAll vampires are wretched creatures, in truth. But none are more wretched than what remains of Ma’Shalled, now and forever bound to guard the catacombs of Narbuk – forced to protect the secrets of the Knights Revenant, and the man he so despised.",

To do that she knew she would need to stop the trickle of High Elven bodies feathered with Dark Elven arrows – so long as her people lost their loved ones to the war, there would never be peace in the hearts of High Elves.\r\n\r\nEven so, someone needed to fight, and if it could not be High Elves then it would have to be others: the ‘auxiliaries’, Aravia’s non-Elven soldiers, mostly clans of Ogryn and Skinwalkers. They had come to Aravia during the Red Crusade as refugees, and Aravia had welcomed them – so long as they served, and so long as they kept to their place.\r\n\r\nQueen Eva envisioned a great wall to defend all of Aravia, and, to keep Dark Elven blades away from High Elven throats, that wall would be defended by the auxiliaries. In exchange for fighting and dying to protect their distant lords, the auxiliaries were offered that which they always wanted: autonomy. With no High Elves present bar a few administrators, there would be few officers to oversee the clans. If the auxiliaries stepped above their station, few would know.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary clans, made up of individuals from multiple races quickly shifted from their remote villages directly to the wall's construction sites. They helped build the strongholds that would guard Aravia, but these castles and gates were not fortifications alone – each became a town, housing entire populations. The officers who led each stronghold were not just commanders of armies, but leaders of their people. They were Warchiefs.\r\n\r\nAt first, each Warchief tended only to their own garrisons, but after the wall – now called Felwin’s Wall, named after its architect – was finished, the Dark Elven attacks continued unabated. To handle the pressure, the Warchiefs united their efforts and formed the Warchief Council, centered on the greatest stronghold on Felwin’s Wall: Felwin’s Gate.\r\n\r\nFelwin’s Gate was the fortress closest to Durham Forest, so it was the easiest target for Dark Elven raiding parties. Over the years, the Gate became the largest and most populous of the settlements along the wall – it was the only way to hold it. The Warchief of Felwin’s Gate hosted the Warchief Council, and was trusted to defend this most-important of fortifications. It was a heavy burden to bear, and never was that burden heavier than during King Tayba’s War.\r\n\r\nThe Warchief of Felwin’s Gate at the time was a Skinwalker named Auronan. He had risen to prominence after years of offering sage counsel and careful strategy – caution that was valued all the more highly after strange rumors drifted from Aravia’s capital. The Queen had grown erratic, her once-peaceful policies turning warlike, and her nobles were sharpening their blades. There was word of dark rituals, evil magic, and even a corrupted chapter of Sacred Order knights moving through the kingdom. The Warchief Council discussed these tidings with grim resolution and, at Auronan’s urging, they prepared themselves for enemies that might come from either side of their wall. It was then that King Tayba’s War began.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the war came when Kaerok struck out at its neighbor, the Free City of Arnoc, an ally of both Kaerok and Aravia. Queen Eva’s answer was immediate: she called the armies of Aravia to war, and marched on Kaerok with all speed. The auxiliaries were left to hold the homeland. It was a perfect opportunity to investigate the spreading darkness in the capital – but that would take time, and time proved to be something Warchief Auronan did not have.\r\n\r\nWithin a week of the war’s beginning, hordes of refugees began arriving at Felwin’s Gate, begging for passage into Aravia. They had supposedly been promised land and shelter by Queen Eva’s armies, and even allowed passage through Durham Forest by the Dark Elves. Were the Dark Elves working alongside Aravia? Warchief Auronan suspected a ploy. He shut the gate on the refugees – until he understood the part these people were meant to play, he dared not let them through.\r\n\r\nThat said, Auronan was not heartless. he sent his people to give out food and medicine, but they were killed – the refugees called them Gaellens, claimed they were sent to kill them, and demanded once more to be allowed to pass. But Auronan’s heart had hardened with the deaths of his clanspeople, and he ordered the gates remain shut. \r\n\r\nAuronan was not afraid of a siege. Felwin’s Gate could hold out forever, if it had to. Unfortunately for him and his people, however, the refugees would soon receive support that was far more dangerous than anything his garrison could manage…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=950#static": "Long ago, the High Elves and Dark Elves were one people: the Elves of Aravia – the oldest and most powerful kingdom in Teleria. But after centuries of proud resistance against the forces of darkness during the Age of Hellfire, a spirit called the Dreamwalker unmade it all. It spoke with countless Elves in their sleep, promising them power, knowledge, beauty, and truth. It gave them magic and wisdom, but all of it was tainted. The Dreamwalker’s gifts turned to poison, in time, and when the Arbiter came to Aravia, she saw it was the work of Siroth.\r\n\r\nThe then-King of Aravia called the first-ever Conclave of the Elves, but his attempts to quell the followers of the Dreamwalker only alienated them. War followed, with the sides split between the King’s loyalists – the High Elves – and those who followed the Dreamwalker – the Dark Elves. Decades of brutal violence only ended with a second intervention by the Arbiter, this time with an army at her back. She forced a Second Conclave of the Elves, but it failed to unite the Elven people, only separating the two sides: the High Elves in Aravia, and the Dark Elves in the neighboring forest of Durham.\r\n\r\nIt was an act that was meant to end the War of the Elves. Instead, it merely changed its flavor.\r\n\r\nConflict sputtered between Aravia and Durham for more than a hundred years. Sometimes the fighting was in the shadows, sometimes it was in the field, but the violence and hatred never stopped. Still, it never came close to full-scale war – until the King of Aravia was killed on a punitive expedition into Durham. Had the Aravian throne been succeeded by a warmonger, the violence would have been terrible… but, instead, the next monarch was his daughter, Eva.\r\n\r\nQueen Eva had dreamed often of a world without war between the High Elves and Dark Elves. Her answer to their constant fighting was twofold: the construction of a great wall, and a new Conclave. Both would cause the war to change again.\r\n\r\nThe wall was intended to end the cycle of violence. It would not be guarded by High Elves, but by Ogryn and Skinwalker auxiliaries – second-class citizens in the eyes of the High Elves, and thus their deaths defending Aravia would not provoke so much anger in its people. Meanwhile, the Conclave would allow dialogue between the High and Dark Elves for the first time in centuries.\r\n\r\nThat wall became known by its designer, Felwin, and its construction had the desired outcome – but Queen Eva’s grand Conclave did not. Most of the dialogue was little more than shouting and accusations, and there was little cooperation. More Conclaves were held – dozens, as the years rolled by – but unity remained out of reach; indeed, more than once Queen Eva had to contend with assassins from the Dark Elves and even her own people. However, the skill of her guards and her own courage won out over her enemies, and, over many decades, the Elves of both realms came to regard Conclaves as preferable to battle. It was a victory, if incomplete.\r\n\r\nAs time dragged on, however, and the Queen grew older, she feared that time would steal her victory away. If achieving true peace should take longer than the span of her life, a more militant successor could quickly undo all her work. Queen Eva’s quest took on a more desperate tenor, and ultimately she reached out to the Dreamwalker.\r\n\r\nQueen Eva discovered that the secretive spirit was more than happy to teach her what he knew. But of course, as in the days of old, the Dreamwalker’s lessons held a poisonous edge. He turned Queen Eva’s desperation, measure by measure, into paranoia. Peace remained her mission, but the Dreamwalker whispered of conspiracy, and the Queen, growing desperate, believed him. In her mind, her enemies quickly multiplied – first within the Elven courts, then among the realms of her neighbors. Peace with Durham would no longer be enough. All of Anhelt would need to be tamed.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point in history that King Tayba of Kaerok shattered centuries of peace and attacked his erstwhile allies in the Free Cities. It was precisely the provocation the Dreamwalker had warned of. At Queen Eva’s furious command, Aravia struck at Kaerok with all of its might, alliances be damned. If Queen Eva could not persuade the powers of Anhelt to accept peace with diplomacy, she would bring peace at the edge of a sword.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=960#static": "The great city-state of Ireth has existed for nearly all recorded history, and for most of its existence, it has been known for its legendary mage academy.\r\n\r\nBut that Ireth is long gone. In its place is a nightmare filled with monsters and madmen. The city’s walls overflow with blood and violence, with the decay of corruption seeping into its very foundations. The blame for this transformation has been laid at the feet of the legendary Grandmaster of the mage academy: the powerful necromancer Bad-el-Kazar.\r\n\r\nKazar was not always an evil soul, but he was always ambitious and highly skilled. Little is known of his early life, beyond that his name was once Valkanen and that he eventually fell to the dark temptations of Siroth. Whether his fall was before or after he fled Ireth following a bloody incident in which dozens of mages and scholars were slain, few know, but when Kazar returned to the city he was a changed man in mind and body. He swiftly took control, letting none stand in his way, even those he once counted as friends, though his victories were always political and peaceful, won with cunning. It seems he desired to keep his allegiance to Siroth to himself, though archived accounts tell of his skin growing more pallid, his veins darker, and his eyes more hollow, with each passing month. A handful of more charitable scholars who have studied Ireth’s history dare suggest that Bad-el-Kazar’s motives were not purely evil. They posit that they were – and may still be – partially rooted in desperation, in a desire to restore life to those slain in the disaster he fled the city after years earlier. Such claims have never been verified.\r\n\r\nInitially, Kazar’s rule was, by most reports, highly successful. The numbers learning in the academy grew, the city's population rose, and each day new discoveries were made… until Kazar led a fateful expedition. Driven by visions supported by his research of archaic texts, Kazar orchestrated a grand voyage from Ireth to the Winterlands in the far north. His goal was to find a site of ancient power, rumored to predate even the Gray Age. Kazar set sail with a fleet, promising to return by the following winter.\r\n\r\nSix years passed, and all were assumed lost. Ireth’s interim Grandmaster was fully inducted into the role. Funerals were held. Life moved on.\r\n\r\nAnd then Kazar’s flagship appeared on the horizon, alone. As the vessel drew close, the onlookers gasped: the crew were little more than bone and rotting flesh. Undead. The most arresting sight of all was Bad-el-Kazar himself, standing at the prow, cloaked in tattered raiment, his flesh gray and dying. He had revealed himself as a necromancer.\r\n\r\nWhen Kazar disembarked his vessel, the crowd parted, and the new Grandmaster approached him with trepidation. Would Bad-el-Kazar choose to punish the hubris of those who had doubted his return? If he did, would any be able to stop him?\r\n\r\nBut Kazar was magnanimous in his victory. He accepted the Grandmaster’s apology, reassumed the mantle of Grandmaster himself, and presented the mage academy with the fruits of his expedition: the cargo hold of his ship was filled with bottle after bottle of a mysterious liquid. It resembled water, but even the least magically sensitive person could sense the power radiating from it. Kazar called it the Water of Life, and claimed it would change the world. None argued. It certainly changed Ireth.\r\n\r\nKazar maintained strict control over the substance, portioning it out carefully to the most powerful mages in the city. They experimented with it, creating potions of incredible power. Consuming these granted the imbiber unbelievable abilities, and hugely amplified their strengths. They called the process Ascension, but it had a dark side. It exaggerated personalities. The cautious became paranoid. The ambitious became obsessive. The agitated became furious. The proud became vain. Psychopathy ran rampant, and the mages' experiments took ever-darker turns. More and more of the academy’s leading members undertook Ascension, and so there were fewer and fewer voices speaking out against the escalations. Test subjects were seized in their beds. Monsters were left to wander the streets. City guards were replaced with twisted mannequins, and the gates were barred to prevent the population from escaping. Madness gripped the city, and that grip has never loosened. \r\n\r\nNone know precisely what became of those trapped within the city’s walls. Those few who escaped spoke of a nightmarish hellscape, as the city twisted itself to serve the mad designs of Ascended archmagi. Among it all was Bad-el-Kazar. Even as his city went mad around him, his subjects remained loyal. He was the undisputed Grandmaster of Ireth.\r\n\r\nThat was centuries ago. Since then, Bad-el-Kazar has been sighted beyond the city’s walls, wandering the backroads of Teleria. What his goals are, none know.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=970#static": "The Ogryn known as the Big ‘Un grew up in an Ogryn tribe in the Dusk Hills – the craggy steppes north-east of the great Arena City of Velyzar. Big ‘Un was remarkable in his tribe, mostly due to his size – which earned him his moniker – but also for his companionable demeanor. His nickname was so apt, and he so jovially embraced it, that its use quickly overtook that of his real name. He was huge and strong, and he declared he would use these qualities to bring prosperity to his tribe. He did not know initially how he could.\r\n\r\nOnce Big ‘Un had reached his maturity, the Gaellen Orcs who traded with his family often remarked that Big ‘Un would make for a fantastic raider. They could use him, they said, the next time they wanted to attack a Nomad encampment. The idea intrigued him, but Big ‘Un was uneasy with their choice of targets. Attacking the neighboring Nomads, whom he had known all his life, felt too much like robbing his own family.\r\n\r\nThe thought of winning his fortune through battle stuck with Big ’Un, however. One year his tribe moved far enough south to receive a caravan from Velyzar, and the merchant sold not only goods, but stories – and Big ‘Un, loving to hear the tales, was her most frequent customer. She told tales of the city's arenas, their mighty gladiators, and their incredible treasures – it only took a few hints that she could get him into the ring for Big ‘Un to declare that his future was there. He made arrangements with the tribe elders for the them to return this far south again in a few years’ time, with dreams and promises he would have a great bag of gold in his grip when they saw him again. After saying his goodbyes, he followed the merchant back to her city.\r\n\r\nBig ‘Un did not wait long to enter Velyzar's arenas, and he flew up the ranks with shocking speed. It took some time for the organizers to find even matches for him, but once they got a measure of his natural advantages he found himself challenged in fights for the first time in his life. Even his great strength and size were barely enough to save him from the incredible skill and power of his opponents. As the fights went on, his injuries mounted, and he feared for his life. It was a feeling he'd never experienced before. \r\n\r\nFortunately, Big ‘Un had one advantage that fight organizers had not accounted for: his affability. Many of his fellow gladiators liked him, and so, as he was worn down, one told him the truth. The fight organizers were building up Big ‘Un’s reputation – they were already calling him a horrifying monster. It was a common tactic for coordinators dealing with Ogryn. Once he was seen as a real menace in the eyes of the audience, the Guild would put him up against a hero from the highest tiers of the Arena, so a fan favorite would have a scary villain to put down. It was a classic trick, and the crowds loved it – but it would mean the death of Big ‘Un.\r\n\r\nSo, after his next fight, Big ‘Un tried to take his winnings and leave. This was something the Guild of Gladiators could not leave unpunished. They buried Big ‘Un in contrived fees and penalties, transforming his fortune into debts.\r\n\r\nTo pay off the Guild, Big ‘Un tried working on Velyzar's docks but, while it was certainly safer than the Arena, he quickly learned that it would never pay enough to buy his freedom. Luck came back around again, however. By chance, he met with an old Orc friend – a Gaellen officer from Big ‘Un’s youth, who had come to the city to try to win in the Arena herself. When Big ‘Un told her about his own experiences she was quick to change her mind, and instead suggested they go into mercenary work. Big ‘Un could leverage his reputation from the Arena and form a mercenary company.\r\n\r\nBig ‘Un would likely not have much of a say in the kinds of work he did, but he was desperate. He agreed, and the two collected a crew of other ex-gladiators and Gaellen Orcs. But their first job would prove to be far tougher than expected: Big ‘Un was contracted to serve guard duty for a particular client, on his way to the Free City of Tilshire – a necromancer who refused to say his name… but bore a striking resemblance to the Grandmaster of Ireth.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=980#static": "The Cult of K’Leth is a vast, complex machine, stretching across every continent in Teleria. Such a massive network of spies, cultists, necromancers, and slaves is impossible to coordinate under one single hierarchy, and so the Cult does not only answer to its all-but-immortal founder. While Losan K’Leth rules where he can, and his commands are obeyed without question, there is plenty of opportunity for lesser leaders among the elite of the Cult – the Knights Revenant – to rise to near-total independence. While that independence grants flexibility, it also renders the Cult vulnerable to great treachery.\r\n\r\nBystophus was a powerful commander in the Knights Revenant. He was the leader of the chapter in the Hallowed Halls, a temple complex that sat among the ruins of a failed ancient Gaellen Pact city near the northern mouth of the Stormwind Wastes. The location is brutally remote. However, that remoteness was strength as much as weakness, for it was one of few regions in all Teleria where the Knights Revenant could operate freely. They used the Hallowed Halls frequently, launching expeditions from it deeper into the Wastes in search of necromantic secrets, lost artifacts, powerful poisons, or other assets that were of great service to K’Leth’s plans. Outposts were scattered through the Wastes to extend the Cult’s reach, and they depended on the supplies that flowed in, and through, the Hallowed Halls. All of those resources were under Bystophus’ direct control.\r\n\r\nHe had been chosen for his loyalty, but Bystophus was not loyal to K’Leth directly – unlike most Knights Revenant, he was loyal to the cause. He believed that the cycle of death and rebirth that the Knights Revenant must face in order to extend their lifespans was sacred. He believed that he – and all Knights Revenant – were better than everyone else down to their souls, and that, in Lumaya’s name, the Knights Revenant would inherit control of all Teleria.\r\n\r\nIt was a level of devotion the Knights Revenant tolerated or ignored, but few shared. Most among their ranks only joined out of greed – immortality is an incredible prize. So, when a mysterious, shadowed figure began lurking in the dreams of many Knights Revenant, their paranoia and cynicism caused them to reject its whispers out of hand. Bystophus was severely lacking in these traits, however.\r\n\r\nBystophus listened to the figure with an open mind and, in the months and years that followed, it wrapped him around its fingers. It spoke of the true power and superiority of the Knights Revenant, and how close Bystophus had come to apotheosis. What’s more, the figure also claimed that Lumaya was, in fact, no patron of the Knights Revenant at all, nor even of Teleria. It said that she kept all the Telerians in bondage – in fear of death – when she could have made them all immortal. Only Siroth had their true interests at heart, it said. Only Siroth could protect them. Only Siroth knew the truth. Bystophus ate up these claims and begged for more.\r\n\r\nAnd so, it was that Siroth found his first true believer among the Knights Revenant. The grand order that K’Leth had built – an order that once believed in nothing but itself – could finally be held in Siroth’s grip. Bystophus was his first supplicant, but he would not be the last. The Knight Revenant was determined others would find the truth, as he had.\r\n\r\nIt took decades for Bystophus’ influence to spread, and with Siroth’s whispered guidance, it did so in secret. His followers remained a part of the Knights Revenant, but to each other, they called themselves the Sect of Siroth. The Sect grew and grew, eventually infiltrating a large portion of the Cult of K’Leth – not only in the Hallowed Halls and its many satellite laboratories, but even as far away as the catacombs of Narbuk. The Sect grew so large that it drew the attention of K’Leth himself… but only after it had become entrenched enough that K’Leth could not cut the cancer out without threatening his whole organization. So, K’Leth was forced to do nothing, not openly. Behind closed doors was another matter, but it meant that Bystophus – and, by extension, Siroth – still had time.\r\n\r\nSiroth had elaborate plans for Bystophus and his Sect – not long-term plans, for K’Leth would no doubt act eventually, but the Sect was still a valuable resource. A war between Kaerok and Aravia; the invasion of the Free Cities; the kidnapping of thousands of refugees. The dominoes would begin to fall. Thanks to Bystophus, a great many Knights Revenant would become the obedient soldiers Siroth had always wished them to be. Even if K’Leth ensured they would not remain so for long.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=990#static": "Mortu-Macaab is truly ancient – one of the Firstborn, the original servants of Siroth and Lumaya. His age and deeds have granted him a high rank in the Demonic hierarchy of Anathraad, but he is by no means Siroth’s most trusted servant. Even Demonspawn born from mortal flesh have been promoted above him.\r\n\r\nSiroth’s disfavor was not the product of change or whim, but of intentional punishment – Mortu-Macaab had once been trusted above all other generals, and had been the commander tasked with defeating the arrayed armies of Teleria during the First Great War. He had faced down heroes the likes of which newer generations could only dream of – Basileus Roanas, Ramantu Drakesblood, even the Arbiter herself. Despite all of Mortu-Macaab's victories, however, Siroth never forgave him for his ultimate defeat – the First Great War had ended in disaster, and Siroth declared that he would never give Mortu-Macaab another chance to disappoint him.\r\n\r\nIn the thousand years that followed, Siroth knew nothing but disaster. The Age of Hellfire; the foundation of the Sacred Order; the Second and Third Great Wars; the Shadowkin rebellion; the betrayals of the Knights Revenant and the Dark Elves... a millennium-long litany of disappointments, and even Siroth’s immortal patience was running thin. To Mortu-Macaab, however, it was an opportunity to reclaim his place at Siroth’s right hand.\r\n\r\nMortu-Macaab's chief opponent was Siroth’s current favorite: a cunning general named Kivos. Kivos was clever and skilled, but physically weak, and for that appeared to command little respect among other Demonspawn. That disloyalty would be Mortu-Macaab’s opportunity. He sent servants among Kivos’ forces with the order to find any who were not happy with their leader, then bribe them into becoming saboteurs and spies. This plan was more successful than expected – there were, apparently, many under Kivos’ command who disliked their commander.\r\n\r\nOnce he had a whole legion of traitors at his beck and call, Mortu-Macaab shifted to the next stage of his plan: he publicly ridiculed Kivos, saying his armies were disorganized and weak. It was a common sort of challenge, the kind many Demonspawn had used over the centuries to instigate a contest of position. Siroth would suppress any challenge if his plans were near fruition, or if he thought the challenge a waste of time, but he let this one stand. Mortu-Macaab grew bold, and Kivos had no choice but to fight, army to army.\r\n\r\nThanks to Mortu-Macaab’s many agents within Kivos’ ranks, he knew Kivos’ plans long before reaching the battlefield. Mortu-Macaab’s spies undermined Kivos’ efforts, fouling equipment, formations, and any semblance of order. Even though his armies appeared to be in disarray, Kivos did not surrender. When the two armies met, Mortu-Macaab gloried in what he was sure was his inevitable victory.\r\n\r\nThis glory was short-lived. The chaos in the enemy formations vanished. They rapidly reorganized, rendering all Mortu-Macaab's advanced knowledge of Kivos' plans worthless. Any advantage his sabotage gained him disappeared within minutes of the battle's beginning, and he suddenly found himself facing a perfectly professional force. That was far better than could be said for his own army, as many of Mortu-Macaab’s servants suddenly broke ranks, abandoned weapons, or turned traitor. Mortu-Macaab's forces were swept aside, defeated by the same subterfuge he himself had planned.\r\n\r\nKivos had predicted Mortu-Macaab’s machinations, and had ordered his own armies to take any bribe offered so long as they remained loyal. Kivos was not loved by his armies, but he did not need to be. He delivered them a victory. Mortu-Macaab had lost, again, and in Siroth’s full view, with the whole of Anathraad jeering at the sight.\r\n\r\nYears later, when Siroth prepared for his fourth assault on the realm of Teleria, Kivos was chosen to lead the armies of Anathraad. It would not be as grand an effort as the First or Second Great Wars had been, but the shame of the Third Great War still lingered among the Demonspawn, and Siroth demanded much greater care and loyalty than ever before. This invasion would be precise, careful, and limited, with just enough force to achieve its strict objectives. It was the sort of war that Kivos was well-suited to, but Mortu-Macaab would still have a part – as a door guard. Siroth commanded Mortu-Macaab to protect the Brimstone Path, with what remained of his battered army. He would witness Kivos’ army march forth, and he would hear every message of every victory that Kivos won. It was the ultimate humiliation.\r\n\r\nMortu-Macaab seethed. He would obey Siroth’s direct command, of course, but if Kivos attempted to retreat through the Path, he would never allow the wretch to pass through. Nobody shames Mortu-Macaab without punishment. None but Siroth.",

It was an old castle that from the outside appeared abandoned, but was clean, well-kept, and warm deep within. She remembers having toys, playing with friends, and exploring the dusty corners of her home. She remembers finding none of that strange.\r\n\r\nLater, she learned the truth: that her innocence was bought with blood and pain from all around her. As far as the world outside was concerned, Demonspawn like her were not born of loving parents. They did not have friends, toys, or childhoods. They did not grow up. To the people of Teleria, the Demonspawn were monsters. They crawled from pits in hellish Anathraad, servants of the dark Lord of Shadow Siroth. They were evil to their core. Their existence was bent purely to the destruction of all living things, and their bloodlust was unending. To the people of Teleria, the Demonspawn were an existential threat, and any sane Human, Elf, Orc, or Lizardman would draw steel and kill a Demonspawn without a moment’s hesitation.\r\n\r\nShielding Alure from the world outside took perpetual vigilance from her family. She had no concept of the sacrifices that her parents made – that all the Demonspawn around her made – to exist at all in Teleria. The secrecy. The lies. The danger entailed with every outing for food and supplies. The preparation, every day, to fight for their lives. All these burdens, carried by the adults around her so that Alure could live a happy life.\r\n\r\nIt did not last forever. Someone hiding in the castle must have made a mistake, or perhaps finally her family ran out of luck. Either way, the Sacred Order fell upon them, Banner Lords forces by their side. Alure was the only survivor, and she would not have even been that if not for the actions of Bad-el-Kazar.\r\n\r\nAlure never learned why he came to the castle. She knew however she had been moments from death, that it was Kazar’s hand that saved her, and it was that hand which led her to safety. She could not help but look past his terrifying visage, for she saw in him a protector. He promised to make her strong. After she witnessed the slaughter of her family, how helpless her defenders had been, strength was the only thing she wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd so Kazar gave Alure strength. While their relationship lacked the warmth that she grew up with, Alure did not resent the lack – indeed, as far as she was concerned, the warmth of her childhood had left her helpless when danger had finally come. So she trained as hard as Kazar demanded, then even harder still. Kazar honed Alure into a blade. She mastered stealth, magic, and the art of the sword, and Kazar conducted dark rituals that unlocked the power of Alure’s Demonic blood and increase her power further.\r\n\r\nBy Alure’s early teens, she was among the most skilled assassins in all of Teleria. She longed to be let loose, to be sent on missions of mass destruction against the Banner Lords, but Kazar refused, bending her instead towards furthering his own inscrutable interests. She was frustrated, but she obeyed. She trusted Kazar, for his strength had saved her, protected her, and prepared her for the world in a way that nothing else had.\r\n\r\nThat trust would prove misplaced. For a blade, no matter how strong, is but a tool. And tools, once broken, may find themselves discarded.",

This massive Ogryn arrived in the company of near-strangers, who did not know his name, only the crime he had been accused of in his former home of Arnoc – murdering Humans and eating their flesh. And thence he earned his name. It was the only one they had for him, for Maneater was unable to share his own – his tongue had been cut out by his accusers. Furthermore, he was illiterate, and when others tried to teach him, nothing got through.\r\n\r\nManeater settled in a Lizardmen village, remaining an enigma. He was a hard worker, quick to volunteer, and more than able. Decades went by, and despite his fearsome physical appearance did not harm a soul. He preferred his own company, fishing when not toiling alongside his neighbors. What's more, he did not seem to age.\r\n\r\nWhen the Gaellen Warclave was founded and recruiters came to the Ogryn's village, they assumed that someone called ‘Maneater’ would be eager to sign up. He refused, and later the Gaellen Pact’s ships sailed off to Anhelt without him. Those like him who remained watched the ships go with fear in their hearts. They could only imagine what horror those aboard might see and experience, and what would happen if the armies failed.\r\n\r\nLess than a decade later, new sails appeared on the horizon. Elves and Humans – from Aravia, Kaerok, and Frostheim – invaded the Sorrowlakes, coming for revenge. When Maneater’s village assembled a hasty militia to stand against the Telerian League, they assumed that Maneater would refuse. To their surprise, Maneater joined. When the enemy came he stood with his fellows, heavy mallet in hand. The foe were warriors from Order of the Conquerors, sick madmen carrying the guise of honorable knights, wielding axes and fueled by hatred.\r\n\r\nWhen the Conquerors fell upon the ragged militia's battle lines, the defenders buckled under their onslaught. The Conquerors were veteran soldiers, filled with a desire for vengeance, while the Lizardmen were armed with only determination and crude weapons. But they did not break. Not one even died. Even those whose throats were cut returned to their feet and fought on – not a drop of blood oozing from their wounds.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of it was Maneater, humming a wordless chant. He fought hard, but never pressed the attack. Those who watched him carefully saw that he did not suffer a single injury at the enemy's hands, but still wounds split open on his skin, blood running down his body from his jaw. He gradually weakened, but still he hummed, and still his fellow militia fought on.\r\n\r\nHorrified by the supernatural events unfolding before them, the Conquerors fled in disorder. Too exhausted and relieved to pursue, the militia turned to Maneater – whose name finally seemed to fit him, as the blood dripping from his mouth made it appear as if he had consumed his enemies’ flesh. But it was his own blood. He surely had worked a spell. The militia brought Maneater back to the village, and while he recovered, the people tried in vain to learn his secret. He could not tell them, and could not write, and so they never truly learned – they could only suspect. Nevertheless, they knew they were saved because of him, and were forever grateful.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1120#static": "To become a vampire is to surrender oneself to Siroth. In return for eternal youth, strength, and power, the individual in question will be condemned to drain the blood of the living forevermore. This thirst for blood cannot be denied for long; even the strongest of wills can do nothing save crumble before the all-consuming desire. For those who do resist the compulsion, the only reward is madness… or worse. \r\n\r\nWithout blood, a vampire devolves into a feral nightmare; a maddened hunter, driven by a hunger it cannot control. Their body deforms, becoming animalistic, and their mind follows suit. Their spirit dwindles to a mere flicker and the newborn 'Seeker' forgets all that they were, becoming little better than the beast they resemble. They take to the night, hunting for prey. The Seeker feasts night after night, glutting themselves as they refused to do while still in possession of their sanity.\r\n\r\nMany Seekers hunt until they are destroyed. Others find themselves pressed into the service of another vampire or a necromancer. Their twisted, bat-like forms are clad in serrated armor, and they are unleashed to battle the foes of their new master. \r\n\r\nSuch was the fate of Vargalis the Maw, one of the most monstrous Seekers to ever exist. Vargalis was once a mighty and feared gladiator of Velyzar, before his death in the arena. As his lifeblood seeped into the sands, Vargalis was offered a chance to live and fight forever by Siroth, who saw in him a being capable of causing much useful mayhem among the living. \r\n\r\nOnce Vargalis learned of what he must do to maintain his new existence, he felt some regret, and kept his feeding confined to those he considered unworthy of life. But on occasion hunger broke even his iron will, and he was sent into a frenzy of slaughter. It was after one such unfortunate incident that Vargalis swore never to taste flesh again. He took himself to a Lumayan monastery, high in the Cloudspire Mountains, and had himself confined to a penitent’s cell. The monks were initially reluctant to entomb a stranger, but Vargalis used his vampiric charms to convince them to accede to his wishes. \r\n\r\nFor long months, Vargalis writhed in agony in his cell, matching his will against his desire. But his suffering was to no avail. His body became twisted and monstrous, and his mind shattered beneath the awful weight of his unholy hunger. He broke free from his confinement, and butchered and drained every monk in the monastery. But his hunger, denied for so long, was not sated. He descended from the mountains, killing anything and everything in his path, gorging on the blood of Dwarven patrols, bandits, and whole villages. \r\n\r\nA necromancer, following rumors of the Seeker’s rampage, tracked the beast to a ruined Dwarven outpost and bound the once-proud gladiator to her will. She arrayed the creature in a twisted parody of the armor he’d worn as a living man, and sent him to slay one of her foes, a servant of the Sacred Order. Vargalis butchered many warriors of the Order until he finally located his quarry and tore him apart, slaking his thirst on the man’s blood before succumbing to the weapons of the survivors.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1160#static": "Deep in the Sorrowlakes, home of the Lizardmen, there is a ruin. It’s barely even that – little remains of it beyond flat land and old stones. The swamps have swallowed most of it, and the jungle has overgrown much of the rest. Without a guide, the place largely resembles an empty field. This ruin is the City of Lost Dreams. It was torn down to the foundations, and even those were pried out of the mud to fill its canals. The city has been erased, in everything but memory. But the memory remains, and its story begins with Rhazin Scarhide.\r\n\r\nRhazin Scarhide was a clan lord. He was cunning, charming, and blessed with the companionship of a Dracomorph, but what made him a legend was simpler: he was in the right place, at the right time, and he was intelligent enough to realize it. The Red Crusade had caused the Sorrowlakes to be flooded with hundreds of thousands of Orc, Skinwalker, Ogryn, and Lizardmen refugees from Anhelt. Those Lizardmen clans that resisted the influx were quickly overwhelmed, but Rhazin invited the newcomers to his lands. He sent emissaries to tent-cities and villages, offering an opportunity: build. Build a home that was theirs.\r\n\r\nThe City of Dreams, as it was later called, became a metropolis in less than five years. Rough canals were smoothed out, then expanded. Tents became houses, then houses became apartments. Sewers appeared, then temples, then workshops, then foundries. The city became an example, then later a promise, of multiracial cooperation. That promise ultimately took the form of a document, drafted by Rhazin Scarhide: the Gaellen Pact.\r\n\r\nThe Pact wasn’t just about building a better home for many, however. It was a dream of vengeance, too. The Gaellens were deeply scarred by the Red Crusade, and too many carried the fires of hate in their hearts for them to find lasting peace. And so it was that Rhazin Scarhide was approached by a group of the most influential warlords of the Sorrowlakes. They wanted to command a unified army of the Gaellen Pact. They wanted a war against the peoples of Anhelt, and they wanted a Warclave to lead the Gaellens in it.\r\n\r\nRhazin knew this Gaellen Warclave would be formed, with or without him, the desire for war was too great. If he refused, it could spark a schism in the city, perhaps even a civil war – Rhazin’s voice held too much sway. He was not convinced that the invasion would succeed even with a unified Gaellen Pact, but he knew it would fail otherwise. So he made the only choice he felt he could: he agreed, with his full support.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough.\r\n\r\nRhazin did everything in his power to ensure that the Warclave had all the resources that the Sorrowlakes could bring to bear. Ships. Weapons. Food. Medicine. Cooks. Mages. Engineers. Plans. While fighting raged in Anhelt, Rhazin converted the City of Dreams into an engine of war. But, after seven years of struggle, the Gaellen invasion of Kaerok was broken. There was nothing left for Rhazin to do but wait for the inevitable retaliation.\r\n\r\nHe did not have to wait long. Princess Scyl of Frostheim came leading a combined force of High Elves, Banner Lords, Frostheim warriors, and Sacred Order knights, and they hit the shores of the Sorrowlakes like a hammer. All too quickly the army was at the edges of the City of Dreams.\r\n\r\nThe city had no walls. Its boundaries had expanded too rapidly for them to be built – Rhazin’s dream had grown too quickly. Hastily erected barricades were no match against the fury of the Telerian League, and the city’s defenders were swiftly overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of Gaellens were killed in the slaughter that followed. Survivors were driven into the jungles, but even though many Gaellens escaped, their ambition was as lost as the city. The City of Dreams had been more than an economic hub – it had been their promise of a better future. And it was lost.\r\n\r\nAs for Rhazin Scarhide, he never emerged. Legends say he died in a duel with Princess Scyl, but most who know the details of the historical record suspect it would have been execution more than battle – Scyl was a warrior in her prime, while Rhazin was close to the end of his years. Nevertheless, neither of them were ever seen again.\r\n\r\nIn the centuries that followed, the Gaellens stopped waiting for Rhazin to reappear. Most have given up hope. But, while Rhazin Scarhide might be gone, his memory is immortal. Anyone can build – all they need is a dream. Perhaps someday the Gaellen Pact will find it again.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1210#static": "Among necromancers there is no greater art than that of Husk construction. To craft the perfect warrior from the bodies of the dead requires a skillful eye and a delicate touch. Not just any corpse will do. To craft an effective Husk, one must scour a recent battlefield and select only the choicest parts from the newly-slain. The arm of a swordsman, the legs of a shield-bearer, the skull of a general… disparate pieces combined into a merciless whole. \r\n\r\nBut finding the right pieces is only the first step in a grueling process. The body must be assembled according to certain rites and stitched together with thread woven from the hair of a hanged man. Armor and weaponry scavenged from barrows and tombs is then attached to the body by means of sutures and hooks. \r\n\r\nThe most difficult part is saved for last. The wretched shell must be imbued with Undeath. There are many possible methods of accomplishing this unholy deed. A necromancer can employ the vital forces of the natural world, often in the form of lightning, to fill the Husk with motive power. They draw these forces into the carcass using forbidden technologies or taboo rituals, and then trap them within the Husk. Or they can use a variety of elixir of restoration made from the blood of Demonspawn or Skinwalkers, combined with various alchemical tinctures, to infuse the monstrosity with something resembling life. \r\n\r\nThe most common method, however, involves trapping the souls of slain warriors and magically fusing them into a cohesive, if not entirely stable, essence. This is also the most dangerous way of accomplishing the empowering of a Husk. If the magics binding them falter for even a moment, the fused souls will attempt to rip themselves apart, inevitably leading to the destruction of the Husk, or worse. Such an occurrence often results in the tormented Husk running amok, slaying its creator, and going on a rampage until it is destroyed. \r\n\r\nWhile the majority of Husks exist only for a short period of time due to being composed largely of rotting bodies, some persist for years, grotesquely outlasting even the putrefaction of their own flesh. One such Husk was the creature known as the Butcher. Crafted from the remnants of a skirmish between a band of Orcs and Kaerok soldiery by an ambitious necromancer, the Butcher was sent to slaughter more warriors in order to assemble a stockpile of fresh parts for its master to experiment with. In the weeks that followed, it slew dozens of foes; Orc champions, knights of Kaerok, and servants of the Sacred Order, who were actively hunting for the Husk’s creator. It took pieces from each person it killed, using the gory trophies to repair itself.\r\n\r\nThe necromancer hoped to create an army of Husks, of which the Butcher was but the first. But the souls that empowered the Butcher grew more fractious with every battle, and it became less and less responsive to its creator’s commands, though the latter paid little attention to this, being more concerned with creating more Husks. Finally, there came a day when the Butcher turned on the necromancer, tearing him asunder with its bare hands and destroying his lair in an orgy of bloody violence. Those who’d been hunting it and its master assumed that it had perished with its creator. \r\n\r\nBut it is said by some that the Butcher continues to roam the battlefields of Kaerok and the surrounding kingdoms, mindlessly continuing its collection of body parts in order to keep itself functioning.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1280#static": "The lofty standards and exacting nature of the High Elves are their blessing and their curse. Justified pride so easily turns to arrogance, and a bruised Elven ego can be a fearsome thing indeed. Snubbed by those he most respected and denied the title that he was obsessed with, Ithos has become a degenerate example of the worst excesses of the High Elf mindset.\r\n\r\nFrom his youngest days, Ithos wished to become the Royal Huntsman, one of the most prestigious titles available to servants of the Aravian monarchs. The Royal Huntsman is the hand of the crown at home and abroad, whose many-fold duties include hunting fugitives, executing dissidents, and spycraft and subterfuge. The Royal Huntsman acts with near-total impunity, answering only to the monarch. Ithos craved the glory of the title, and more so desired the absolute freedom to act as judge, jury, and executioner to the enemies of his people. \r\n\r\nThough Ithos excelled at the various examinations and trials that would-be Royal Huntsmen are subjected to, when his mind was probed by skilled Aravian interrogators they found him to be too mentally unstable and self-absorbed to truly fit the role. They sensed his true desires: a license to hurt and kill without consequence, unquestionable status, and a shroud of fear to wear. With the blunt scorn that many say is typical of High Elves, they told him point-blank that his temperament was unsuitable and that he was permanently disqualified from the role of Royal Huntsman. Ithos did not take it well.\r\n\r\nIthos swore that his examiners were incompetent and that his talents were unmatched, conjuring conspiracies against him in his febrile imagination. When another, anonymous, candidate was raised to the status of Huntsman, Ithos vowed to show the Aravian bureaucrats that he, and no other, was the greatest hunter in the land and the most deserving of the role. Without seeking permission, Ithos embarked on a campaign of savage terror against those he perceived as the greatest threats and humiliations to the Kingdom of Aravia – some of whom were longstanding antagonists to the state, while others were simply those who got in Ithos’ way.\r\n\r\nA notable anti-Elf propagandist of Human stock living in Arnoc thought himself safe in his high tower, beyond the borders of Aravia. His lofty abode exploded in a tremendous flame that lit the night sky like the noonday sun, causing it to collapse and burn to ruin. A trading company run by recalcitrant Dwarves reneged on a deal with one of the Aravian merchant guilds, only to find the president of their enterprise torn to pieces, his limbs and organs scattered around his warehouse and his blood soaking and defiling their valuable inventory. An Orc warlord who dared launch raids against Aravian caravans was stalked and harried until he went mad, even as he fled across Peltas to try to escape Ithos’ reach. Witnessing his friends and companions murdered one by one by his seemingly all-powerful hunter, his mind cracked from the stress and grief, and the Orc fled gibbering into the desert and perished from exposure. More gruesome tales exist, too horrible to relate.\r\n\r\nWhen the Aravian authorities heard of Ithos’ mad quest to usurp the Royal Huntsman, they were largely appalled. A few in the Aravian ministries of justice tacitly or overtly offered approval of Ithos’ activities, however. They argued for the utility of an unofficial Huntsman, a deniable asset whose goals largely if incompletely overlapped with their own – even if Ithos and his methods lacked the expected restraint and subtlety of those of a true Huntsman. A spirited debate ensued, but in the end royal judgment fell against Ithos and his backers. Whatever use Ithos could be to the crown was deemed to not be worth the ignominy of his deeds, and the likelihood that eventually his twisted judgment would place innocents or even important personages at risk.\r\n\r\nThose who had examined Ithos were held accountable for his rampage, since they were the ones who rejected and subsequently released him back into the general populace, when in retrospect they should have detained him and his dangerously troubled mind. With bitter irony, the true Royal Huntsman was assigned the task of finding and apprehending Ithos – the ‘impostor’ Huntsman. A deadly game is now quietly unfolding across Aravia, frequently spilling out beyond their borders as Ithos roams the breadth of Teleria in his delusional work. If nothing else, Ithos may soon get his chance to compare his skill to the person chosen instead of him.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1330#static": "Since the Age of Hellfire, Orc leaders have often been advised by individuals from three particular castes of magic-wielders – the Shamans, the Bonekeepers, and the Seers. All were initially fed by the powerful range of emotions experienced by Orcs in ancient times, which the Shamans initially learned to master and channel into sorcerous energies. But while the Shamans grew strong out of the belief that it was the positive emotions, such as courage or love, that were best used as a focus for their energies, the Bonekeepers and the Seers took on quite different roles. The Bonekeepers became the guardians of the varied Orc beliefs of the afterlife, while the magics the Seers employed tended toward darker sorceries, born out of feelings once characterized as less worthy – anger, hatred, and frustration. They also proved particularly adept at the magics associated with prognostication, seemingly able to scry the future through ritual. \r\n\r\nThe Shamans disapproved of such practices, and for a time there was a sectarian divide between the three castes of sorcerers. Eventually they reached an uneasy accord, admitting that all emotions had their place, but to this day each caste remains a separate entity, respecting its fellows but maintaining its own traditions. \r\n\r\nOne Seer of the present day is Vorag Blackmane. Both Vorag and her sisters, Valga and Enga, were born with potent sorcerous abilities, though both their magics and their personalities could hardly have been more divergent. Whereas Valga adhered to the shamanistic qualities of duty, honor, and bravery and Enga became fascinated with death, Vorag proved to have a cunning and vicious mindset, and displayed prophetic powers. After correctly foretelling the breakdown of trade negotiations with a neighboring clan and then speaking of the death of the chieftain’s partner during a hunting accident before it happened, she was taken in by the Seers. She was soon fully capable of reading potential coming events in the entrails of sacrificed animals and in the patterns of storm clouds.\r\n\r\nVorag’s abilities saw her employed in the capacity of Seer by the Urug clan. Under her guidance, the clan chief survived several assassination attempts, and soon brought a number of other, lesser clans under his influence. At the Battle of Bloodstone, fought against a powerful rival confederation, Vorag’s magical abilities helped turn the tide. She blanketed the mountainous terrain in darkness that confounded the Urug’s enemies while allowing the clan’s warriors to still see as though they fought in perfect daylight.\r\n\r\nThe victory, combined with Vorag’s adept political maneuverings, brought prosperity to the Urug, until events overtook her predictive skills. A plague struck down the clan, spreading with ferocious rapidity. Vorag was no healer, and the clan's Shamans, who might heal the sick, were struck down. The same fate befell the Bonekeepers who, if nothing else, could have provided the necessary death-rites and comfort the clan in their losses. Vorag herself barely survived infection. She wished she knew what her sisters did.\r\n\r\nWith the Urugs decimated, Vorag chose self-imposed exile, dismayed at just how much her own powers had been found lacking. She resolved to tread beyond the path of the Seer, and seek out Valga and Enga. Her belief was that, if all three sisters joined their knowledge together, they could transcend the limitations of their individual powers by teaching one another their abilities. Such an act would be considered blasphemy by many Seers, Shamans, and Bonekeepers, yet it would also mean Vorag would never again find herself at the mercy of circumstance or cruel fate.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1360#static": "The Lizardmen of the Sorrowlakes have long sought to breed the lesser spawn-creatures of their kind into new, stable subspecies. These attempts were at their height during the Gaellen War, when the pressures of conflict with the Telerian League caused some Lizardmen clan leaders to look for any advantage, crossbreeding and enhancing their creations in much the same way the nobility of Kaerok bred their hounds for size, intelligence, or viciousness. Some experiments were more successful than others – the famed Vergumkaar, for example, remains unparalleled in terms of his intelligence, size, and strength, but was the only one of his particular kind successfully created.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, a number of Lizardmen spawn-breeders succeeded in creating a stable and relatively easily replicated genus. These beasts, with leathery wings and snapping beaks, bear more than a passing resemblance to the great dragons of old, so it is little surprise that, likely believing a link to the Dragonkin Empire would further enhance their reputation, the breeders named their new creations Dracomorphs.\r\n\r\nThe Dracomorphs were highly popular among the Lizardmen, and with good reason. More than mere beasts, they proved intelligent and learned quickly. Even more impressively, they were found to be magically attuned. Though they were not capable of great spellcrafting or vast sorcerous feats, they were able to instinctively channel their energies into spitting out bolts of lightning or debilitating nearby foes with magic that weakened muscles and made bones brittle.\r\n\r\nWhile these traits certainly set the Dracomorphs further apart from the other, more basic companion beasts bred by the Lizardmen, it was their venom that proved to be their deadliest trait. Stored in an enclosed pouch in the gullet, it turned highly corrosive on contact with air. The Dracomorphs were capable of spitting this poison great distances, making them even deadlier on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the Dracomorphs helped prolong the Gaellen War, but they alone were not enough to reverse the victories of the Telerian League. A great many Dracomorphs were killed, and Telerian generals paid bounties to their soldiers for the heads or wings of the beasts.\r\n\r\nDespite this, the genus was not wholly wiped out. In the years following the war, Dracomorphs became status symbols among the surviving Lizardmen clans. At birth, the spawnling of a clan chieftain would often be gifted with a Dracomorph egg by their parents, spending their first night sleeping by its side. Dracomorphs live long lives, sometimes even longer than Lizardmen, and the hope was that the chief’s spawnling would form a bond with the one they were paired with. If this was the case, the Lizardman in question could be assured that they would have a stalwart bodyguard and companion for life, for Dracomorphs are fiercely loyal.\r\n\r\nThanks to the fraught nature of life in the Sorrowlakes, it is not unknown for Dracomorphs to perish in the defense of their bond partner. More rarely, however, it is the Lizardman who is slain while the Dracomorph lives on. In such circumstances, the creatures are often riven with a terrible guilt and separation sorrow, and rarely bond with a Lizardman again. With this connection lost, many wander away from their clan, and they are left to do so. It is seen as impossibly cruel to keep such a bereft creature with those who will forever remind it of its slain bond partner.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of these cases involved the eldest son of the Nakkala clan, Atzii, and his Dracomorph, Trekk. The Nakkala had fought a series of clashes with a rival clan, the Kat’to, and Trekk had earned many honor scars in Atzii’s defense. However, he could not detect the poison that had been slipped into Atzii’s food on the night he was set to ascend to the role of clan chief.\r\n\r\nAtzii perished. Blinded by rage and guilt, Trekk set out to make the Kat’to pay. Over a series of months, he stalked and slew their hunting parties and used his innate magics to bring sickness upon their village by depositing venom in their wells and food stores. Starving and weakened, the clan became easy prey for a vengeful assault by the Nakkala, led by Atzii’s younger brother. Trekk refused to bond with him or anyone else in his old clan, however, and departed, seemingly intent on wandering Teleria in search of some new purpose behind his existence. Among the Lizardmen, it is claimed that only the greatest leader will be able to bond with him and recreate the link he once shared with Atzii. Many have tried, but thus far, Trekk has rejected them all.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1430#static": "The Dungeon of Torments is one of the most infamous locations in the cursed realm of Anathraad, a place dedicated to the most terrible tortures that mortal minds can conceive. Its warden is the tyrannical Lord Shazar, a being who, to the enemies of Siroth bound within its depths, is a walking nightmare. His heavy tread brings with it the promise of agony and misery, merciless and brutal. At his command is a veritable army of sadistic Demonic jailers and torturers, hungering Fellhounds, and bloodthirsty Hound Spawn. It would surely surprise those who suffered at his hand to know that Shazar was once a mere mortal, capable of love, compassion, and remorse. It is certainly unknown to the Demonspawn known as Helicath, who desires Lord Shazar’s position greatly and plots daily to have him hauled into the Doom Tower and chained away forever behind the Arbiter’s nigh unbreakable magical wards and bars.\r\n\r\nIn his life before the dungeon, Shazar served as an executioner-for-hire in Kaerok and wider Anhelt. The Free Cities needed someone willing to perform the executions prescribed by their courts, and though such a job comes with stigma, it paid well enough. Although he sometimes did the duties of the hangman, Shazar's preferred method was beheading, using his great broadsword in an act that he considered more merciful than letting the condemned dangle from a rope.\r\n\r\nIt was grim work and in those early years Shazar was careful to separate it from the rest of his life. He was a loving husband and father, and he spoke often of his hope that one day he would be able to collect enough earnings to leave his thankless duties behind. Certainly, he took no pleasure in doling out death.\r\n\r\nBut slowly, that began to change. Those who claim to know something of Shazar’s origins tell how his troubles began when he beheaded a cultist of Siroth. They say that as he met his death at Shazar’s hand, the cultist cursed his executioner. Others believe that Shazar’s descent was the inevitable consequence of his grizzly job, for wherever death, killing, and suffering abound, the energies of darkness will pool and spread. \r\n\r\nShazar had been taking work in a blacksmith and, with some money and stores saved up, his family had hopes that their lot might finally change. When Shazar began to take more execution work they did not understand why. People knew something was wrong when their executioner’s family left town. But Shazar stayed on – he had now started to take other work, conducting interrogations and torture for anyone who asked. He named his sword ‘Dismemberer’ and when performing his execution duties, discarded the mask traditionally worn, revealing his identity in a quest for infamy. It worked, and it wasn’t long before Shazar gained a bloody reputation. Rumors of his approach unsettled folk as thieves lay low and streets lay hushed. \r\n\r\nAfter so much killing, the faces he saw before him meant nothing to Shazar – that is until the last execution he conducted as a mortal man. This time it was his wife who lay upon the block, accused of stealing to feed their son. She begged Shazar to relent, but he did not recognize her until he had already sliced his blade through her neck. Only too late did the reality of what he had become strike home.\r\n\r\nShazar’s world collapsed. He wandered into the wilderness. Perhaps guided by the darkness within, he made contact with Demonspawn and went willingly with them into Anathraad where he sought to confess what he had done to Siroth. He wanted to be punished by the cruelest judge imaginable, and Siroth was happy to oblige. Pleased with Shazar’s sin, the God of Shadow condemned Shazar to be his executioner and torturer for all eternity. He infused Shazar with Darkness, weaving it into every cell in his body. It smothered what good remained in him and emboldened and strengthened every bitter memory, cruel thought, and shameful desire. Shazar was transformed, his form becoming bulged with muscle, and thick horns and spikes jutted from his head and arms. All of his thoughts were turned to malice, and the infliction of pain. He was a Demonspawn.\r\n\r\nSince that day, Lord Shazar has put his Darkness to work in the Dungeon of Torments. Sometimes he ventures into Teleria, seeking out beings condemned by his dark master. In his fist he still carries Dismemberer, the sword now twisted and warped by the Demonic energies that coarse through its wielder. This sword has been the bane of prince and pauper for centuries, but those who die by its blade can at least rest in peace – a far better fate than for those dragged to the depths of Anathraad.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1440#static": "According to legend, Prince Kymar is one of the oldest of those Demonspawn who were not born directly of Siroth’s dark power. Once an Elf noble of Aravia, Kymar was prone to hedonistic pursuits, and many of those who valued Aravia’s strength and stability were relieved that he was far from the direct line of succession.\r\n\r\nOver time, the prince grew embittered at the fact that he was not set to assume the throne, and frequently quarreled with his older brothers and sisters. Derided as indolent, he was caricatured as a noble only concerned with spending his lavish wealth and hunting or feasting with his cronies. Some Elves pointed out that Kymar did at least try to become learned in matters of statecraft and leadership, and had even dabbled in the magic arts, but the stereotype of a foolish and arrogant dilettante prevailed.\r\n\r\nRelationships between Kymar and the rest of his family continued to deteriorate, until there was an irreparable rupture between the prince and his eldest sister, Alandra. At this point, Siroth made his move, for he had followed the prince’s faltering progress from afar, his dark consciousness attuning to Kymar’s bitter dreams. Siroth orchestrated a plot in which an assassin made an attempt on Alandra’s life. It failed, but saw Kymar framed for the crime. The prince flew into a rage at the accusations leveled against him, and when guards were sent to arrest him, he slew them with his bare hands. Cursing his family, he fled into exile.\r\n\r\nIn those darkest hours, Kymar decided Siroth was his only hope of seizing what he believed should have been his all along – the crown of Aravia. Deep in the wilderness, he sought out a portal to the nether-realm of Anathraad. When he eventually unearthed it – in a dormant state – within a long-forgotten shrine, he had no hesitation in using what magics he had learned to awaken it with his own blood. In stepping through, Kymar became one of the first mortals to voluntarily pass into Siroth’s realm since the Sin of Dragons.\r\n\r\nSiroth welcomed Kymar like a long-lost son. For Kymar there was relief – his fears of being met with Demonspawn and all manner of horrors to gain the Shadow God’s attention left him. Instead he marveled as Siroth took him on a tour of his infernal, unnatural kingdom. \r\n\r\nKymar did not intend to submit wholly to the forces of darkness, but had hoped rather to bargain with them. Kymar was a being of ambition and intelligence, or so Siroth claimed, and if Kymar were the king of Aravia, Siroth was certain a fair agreement could be made between the two of them. The question that Siroth posed to Kymar was simply this: did the prince have the strength to take back his homeland?\r\n\r\nKymar was convinced he did, and intended to prove as much. Siroth promised that, if Kymar became King of Aravia, he would give him back his soul in full, but until then, he would have to accept the Shadow God’s benediction and take on the aspect of demonhood. Confident in his eventual triumph, Kymar did so, and joined the ranks of the Demonspawn.\r\n\r\nWith a darkening sense of purpose, Prince Kymar led an army of Demonspawn in a campaign against Aravia. At the battle of the Silent Vale, he met his elder sister, Alandra, in the thick of the fighting and, after a wrathful exchange, slew her. Only when her body lay broken in his hands did he experience one last moment of regret. It passed quickly. Alandra would have had him executed, of that he was sure, had he remained in Aravia. All that mattered now was that he was one step closer to the throne.\r\n\r\nDespite Alandra’s death, Silent Vale was a defeat for the treacherous prince. Siroth was enraged by Kymar's failure. For a long time Prince Kymar wandered in despair, abandoned by both his kin and the god he had sworn himself to. Only with time did he find purpose again – he realized that, being immortal now, he had all the time he needed not only to conquer Aravia, but to make himself king of all of Teleria. In an effort to recover his standing following his defeat, he set about slowly building a base of power among his fellow Demonspawn, where his cunning and charm proved most effective. Sometimes, among mortals who have taken up Demonhood, Kymar’s name and title are finally spoken with some of the respect he knows they deserve. If his ambitions are realized, a day will come when he’ll cease being merely ‘Prince’ Kymar, and become the king he has always intended to be.",

His mission was to reclaim, with blood and war, all the lands the Humans had stolen from the Orcs during the Red Crusade, many centuries in the past. Artak’s quest dominated every aspect of the clan’s life, and the young were praised only for their aggression and prowess in battle.\r\n\r\nGalek grew up as a quiet and introspective youth, and many mistook his silence for shyness. He rarely partook in revelry or raucous celebration, instead favoring books at home or listening to the tales of the clan’s Cantadella – a song-keeper tasked with remembering the histories of the Orcs and the Gaellen Pact. On this steady diet of knowledge and history, Galek had difficulty navigating the politics of his clan. His mother, Arax, only made it harder. \r\n\r\nArax was the Cantadella of an Orc clan from the northern realm of Frostheim – the Humans of that mountainous kingdom had far friendlier relations with the Orc clans living on their lands. The revanchism that had so poisoned Artak and his allies could find no grip in the Orcs of Frostheim, nor in Arax. She had married Artak to cement an alliance, though there were whispers she had been sent to try to temper Artak’s rage. She did not succeed with her husband, but her son proved more pliable. From her, Galek learned the value of life, patience, and perspective, and he sought to avoid partaking in war. Galek's peers found his values repulsive. As firstborn of the clan’s warlord, skill in battle was expected of him, and they punished him for any lapses. Fortunately, Galek bore incredible strength in his blood, and learned quickly from the brutal attacks from his ‘friends’. It did not take long for Galek to grow into the finest warrior in the clan, second only to his father.\r\n\r\nThen Galek’s mother passed on, and there was no one left to protect him from the cycle of war he had tried to avoid all his life. Artak was quick to draw Galek onto the battlefield, but with every step Galek felt his true self slipping away. Fortunately for him, there were higher powers at play, and dreams of a golden woman with hair as red as his own changed his life forever.",

However, unlike Aravia’s neighbors, Kaerok and Frostheim, the monarchs of the Elves had the power to choose their successors. Often they picked one of their children, but in cases where they had none to choose from, or when those children rendered themselves somehow unsuitable, the ruling monarch could select an individual who they felt was fit to take the throne. So it was for Queen Eva and her niece, Elhain.\r\n\r\nElhain had always had the eye of her royal aunt, Queen Eva, who had an interminable hand in her upbringing, for the Queen had no children of her own. Eva chose wisely: Elhain’s immeasurable gifts and intelligence grew as she did, and Elhain was an intense scholar, even from a very young age. She was often found reading even late into the night, the subjects of her studies ranging from playful stories to ancient histories.\r\n\r\nBelieving that Elhain’s deep desire to learn was a mark of great things to come, Queen Eva expanded Elhain’s tutelage. Elhain took quickly to magic and martial arts, particularly archery, but she remained a scholar at heart, and her chief interest became something unpalatable to most of her tutors: the schism between the High Elves and the Dark Elves.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen began grooming Elhain for leadership and suggesting that she could declare Elhain her successor, Elhain took her studies beyond the pages of the books she read. Instead of merely wishing to learn more about the War of the Elves, she began to wonder if there might not be something that could be done.\r\n\r\nLeaning on her royal aunt for support, Elhain scoured the libraries and archives of Aravia to retrieve any records or accounts of the War of the Elves. She sought to understand the Dark Elves, but not simply so that she might better know her enemy – it was so she could turn them into a friend.\r\n\r\nThe Queen approved of Elhain's quest, but, like all High Elves, she had her doubts. She could never have imagined how far Elhain’s mission would take her.",

But her orphanage was no ramshackle hut or crumbling temple, like in most of the cities of Kaerok. No, Athel was raised in the Eternal Citadel, the beating heart of the Sacred Order. She was a foundling, having been anonymously deposited on the step of a minor side gate as a baby. It was there that she was discovered by none other than Godseeker Aniri, the prelate in charge of inducting new recruits. It was a relationship that would come to define Athel’s life.\r\n\r\nAthel was an unusual acolyte for the Sacred Order. She was extremely adept at anything she put her mind to, and showed great promise in her religious studies, magical aptitudes, and combat training – some even called her a savant. Her skills earned her great praise, and when Aniri took on the title Godseeker and transferred to the Eternal Citadel – the Sacred Order’s cathedral-city – Athel was allowed to join her. But it was in the Eternal Citadel that Athel found herself in trouble, for she proved to be both willful and curious – a dangerous combination in the Sacred Order.\r\n\r\nAthel asked too many questions of what her instructors proclaimed were ‘the wrong sort,’ and she refused to take their answers at their word. When a tutor made a statement, Athel needed proof of its veracity. But while the Order taught that questioning mathematics, arcanistry, or science was welcome… doing the same for doctrine, or historical narratives? Such an act was unspeakable, even dangerous. While the Godseeker cared for the girl, she often punished Athel harshly – if only to protect her from even greater censure that might be demanded by the temple’s leadership.\r\n\r\nEventually, Athel found an unlikely ally in the form of Shamael, a fellow student – and the top of his class. She began working with him, training and drilling on a daily basis, quickly catapulting herself to the upper echelon of her own year.\r\n\r\nAthel’s appetite for knowledge soon blossomed into an all-out obsession… but it brought her into contact with answers that none in the Sacred Order were ready to face.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1510#static": "Kael is a black sheep among Dark Elves: he is not a cynic. He began his road away from nihilism at a very young age, when he fled Durham Forest and went to one of the Free Cities, where he made a favorable impression in one of its foremost academies and secured permission for a permanent post. There Kael gained something that would change his life: access to a massive library of knowledge not curated by the Dark Elves. By the time of his return to Durham Forest, Kael could hardly recognize his home. The place had swiftly become a pit of infighting, exploitation, and competition, and the struggle for power and influence was life-and-death for many. It was a life Kael wanted no part of.\r\n\r\nKael proved to be an enigma to his people. Knowledge and contacts among Humans he gained gave him considerable leverage and he was an undeniably capable mage, yet he - inexplicably - did not strive for power like a proper Dark Elf, with exploitation and murder. Even worse, as his research bore fruit he had become a High Elf 'sympathizer' – he even dared suggest that the High Elves and the Dark Elves were far more alike than different.\r\n\r\nThough those beliefs could have cost him dearly, Kael was unbothered by any of the consequences save one: access to the peace talks between the Elves. Even then, he initially had not been concerned – while he would have liked to interview some High Elves, he had little hope the negotiations were any more than an opportunity for politicians to shout at each other, with little hope for constructive dialogue. But then he learned of the cave networks that ran beneath the capital city of Aravia. They were incredibly ancient – some reaching all the way back to the Gray Age… and perhaps beyond. What secrets could they hold? He had to find out. He spent favor after favor, and he finally secured a position in the next conclave. It was a choice that would reshape his life forever.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1570#static": "To the minor acolytes in the Cult of K’Leth, the Knights Revenant portray themselves as stalwart guardians and virtuous warriors, battling to share the blessings of immortality regardless of rank. There are some, however, who do not bother with the theatrics. Among them is the woman now known only as the Skullcrown, a figure seen not as a noble savior, but as a harbinger of terror and death.\r\n\r\nThe adherents of K’Leth are sworn to secrecy regarding the organization. The nature of its rituals and the identity of its members are closely guarded, as are its military, political, and financial activities. The secrecy enforced on new members from the beginning is absolute, and it falls to the Skullcrown to ensure it is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Skullcrown acts as judge, jury, and executioner. She enforces the internal laws of K’Leth unstintingly, hunting down those accused of even minor of infractions. This discipline does not extend to the actual Knights Revenant themselves – if ever the concept of a rule for one and one for another has held true, it is for the Cult of K’Leth and its deceitful hierarchy. With other members, however, the Skullcrown is merciless, and the mere thought of her taking interest in a particular follower or cult cell is enough to ensure obedience.\r\n\r\nFew remember a time before the Skullcrown’s role as the cult’s grim enforcer. Once named Almira, she was the child of Ulrath, a Human necromancer. She served as her father’s apprentice and assistant, guarding a centuries-old Demonspawn skull that Ulrath used as a focus for many of his rituals. The cursed relic whispered to its owner, telling them of lies spoken in its presence. \r\n\r\nWhile Ulrath made advances in his work, the immortality he sought always came with a price. Even though he cheated age and disease, his body suffered, always lingering on death's precipice. Almira, now a full-grown woman and a talented sorcerer of her own, grew sick of the rancid nature of most necromantic magics, of the endless festering cadavers and unquiet spirits. She yearned for what she thought of as a purer form of immortality, one that didn’t turn both the body and soul rotten down the ages.\r\n\r\nThe Cult of K’Leth was the answer to Almira's quest. After discovering the shadowy organization and their soul transference, she swore herself to the organization, and stole her father’s Demonspawn skull and handed it to them to prove her loyalty. Quick-witted, she soon realized that only those at the top had the greatest chance of receiving new bodies. She began proving her worthiness by informing on her fellow cultists, exposing one who was selling soul gems as magical trinkets and another who often spoke far too publicly at the local tavern. She was not the first Knight Revenant to take such a route, but she quickly proved herself among the most ruthless. When another member of the Cult known for rooting out sedition, Markar, was himself exposed by Almira and executed for misusing his station, senior Knights Revenant chose to return her Demonspawn skull to her, after having it fashioned into a fearsome helm.  \r\n\r\nAware of the importance of reputation, Almira renamed herself the Skullcrown, after her helm. Even since, she has worked tirelessly to ensure absolute loyalty toward the cult. Indeed, so fearsome has her reputation grown that rumors persist she is now the leader of a band of enforcers, garbed in identical armor with helms crafted in the likeness of the Demonspawn skull, enhancing the idea that she is everywhere at all times, forever ready to punish dissent.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1640#static": "Nazana was once known as the Mistress of Pacts and the Keeper of Contracts. None understood the complex bargains woven by Siroth and his most powerful Demonspawn as comprehensively as she did.\r\n\r\nA Firstborn Demon, Nazana was at Siroth’s side since before the Great Divorce. The Shadow God has always been a master of bargains and deals, and his hellish realm in Anathraad mimics the will of its ruler. Pact-making is a vital part of what passes for Demonspawn society. Demons and the factions they belong to make oaths of allegiance, or temporary pacts, or haggle and bargain over all manner of matters, be it territory, the loyalty of underlings, or promises of future aid.\r\n\r\nThis culture extends to Demonic dealings with the mortals of Teleria. Many are those who have sworn something to a Demon of Anathraad, or indeed to Siroth himself. There is not a species that hasn’t yet heard the Shadow God’s promises whispered in the dark.\r\n\r\nFealty and loyalty are the Demonspawn’s first and most common demands, but there is almost no end to the number of mortals who have offered their very souls – or the souls of others – in exchange for the unholy boons Siroth and his minions offer. Many and multifarious are the pacts made, and Nazana kept track of them, her unnatural mind playing host to a vast array of damnable knowledge. At Siroth’s command, she could recite every drop of blood spilled, every life taken, and every promise made by both mortals and Demons in their dealings with one another. This made her supremely powerful and influential, but Nazana had no interest in bargains of her own. All she did was in service to the Shadow God, and her only desire was to see that each and every contract was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAt times, Nazana was dispatched to remind pact-makers of their outstanding debts, or to enforce terms. Razor-witted and beautiful in a terrifying sense as she was, there were few either in Anathraad or Teleria who could deny the accuracy of her claims or attempt to renegotiate matters. For those foolish enough to attempt to renege entirely, Nazana showed that she was far more than just a litigator. She was judge, jury, and executioner, and accepted no plea of innocence.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came to deal death, Nazana moved with lightning speed. She could cut an armored knight to pieces in seconds with her wicked talons or punch her barbed tail through all manner of cover, giving her enemy no place of refuge. Even the most arrogant and shortsighted of mortals knew that a bargain struck with Siroth could not be idly set aside or circumvented, for any that tried would meet a painful end beneath Nazana’s cold, wicked claws.\r\n\r\nNazana’s eventual betrayal of Siroth angered him deeply. She saw his failures in war after war, and felt all her efforts over her long existence wasted. After being sent on a mission to the Dusk Hills, she never returned, instead she joined a group of Demonspawn who had given up on Siroth after the Second Great War and had made a home within a volcano. It took much to persuade them of her abandonment of Siroth, but they allowed her to join them, and she found something she never expected: love. It resulted in the birth of a baby girl, Alure, but the happiness Nazana experienced was short-lived. A Sacred Order host bent on slaughter stormed the Demonspawn’s home, and only Alure survived. Nazana was thus banished back to Anathraad, where Siroth awaited her.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1740#static": "Zargala grew up accustomed to blood and battle, the daughter of a mercenary chieftain who led the band known as the Usurpers. With a sharp, humorous wit and a streak of rebelliousness, she became childhood friends with the son of another Usurper, Grengar. The two were almost like brother and sister, and secretly hoped to one day leave the warband and found their own warrior-group. \r\n\r\nThe Usurpers worked for a while quelling a peasant uprising in eastern Kaerok, their services paid for by a Banner Lord named Sir Marston. They did so without realizing they had slipped into the midst of a dangerous feud. Many of the peasantry worked in land that was contested between Sir Marston and the neighboring lord, Sir Kentz. The presence of Orc mercenaries gave Kentz an opportunity to strike. He declared that he would intervene to protect ‘his' people from the rapacious Orc attacks.\r\n\r\nGrengar and Zargala were preparing to depart on the very same night that Kentz attacked. They abandoned their plans as the Usurper camp was assailed by Kaerok knights and men-at-arms. The slaughter was fierce, and Zargala witnessed her father killed in the melee. She herself was knocked out, and didn't wake until it was all over.\r\n\r\nAs Zargala came round she found herself amid her slain friends and family. Grengar was among them – he looked to have fallen while trying to protect her unconscious body. Filled with sorrow and rage, Zargala took up her father's great ax and set out after Kentz's forces.\r\n\r\nShe tracked them until she found them at a narrow river crossing in battle with a group of Orcs Zargala did not recognize – Kentz, it seemed, was taking the opportunity to rid the land of all Orc warriors.\r\n\r\nZargala wasted no time. First, she hacked down the guards protecting the Humans' horses – which the knights had left on the near bank as they attacked across the ford – then set them loose. In the chaos that followed she raised a racket in the nearby woods, beating her ax against tree trunks, rattling branches and roaring. She then stepped to the edge of the trees and pretended to give encouragement to non-existent Orc warriors behind. While they were disoriented by the horse stampede and the threat of an assault to their rear, the Humans were counterattacked by the Orcs they were fighting, led by one with a mane of red hair who wielded twin axes. The knights broke and Sir Kentz escaped.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath, Zargala met with the Orc leader. She recognized him from a chance meeting years before, where she had encountered him on his strange quest to take a Human orphan to the Eternal Citadel, the headquarters of the Sacred Order. His name was Galek, and he offered Zargala a place in his band. She turned him down, but agreed to travel with him until they had left the borders of Kaerok. The two quickly rekindled the embers of a friendship born from that bizarre meeting many moons ago, enlivened by Zargala's humor and Galek's earnest good nature. As summer follows spring, love blossomed between them.\r\n\r\nThe two Orcs were, however, forced to part ways in body, if not in affection. Zargala never lost her desire to see Sir Kentz' head atop a pike, and was devoted to see the deed done. When Galek left his band to answer a ‘call' he could not explain, she was devastated. Both knew their purposes, for the time being, lay with causes besides that of their love for each other. They vowed they would find each other again, one day.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1750#static": "The Palace of Aravia is no stranger to the beautiful and the powerful. Once in a dozen centuries, however, there may come an Elf who’s beauty and power exceeds that even of their fellows. \r\n\r\nWith royal blood and highly promising magical talent, Lyssandra was bound to have her name carved into the palace’s hall of heroes. As a youth, she was praised for her fair features and elegant manners. While other children spent their time playing, she frequented the hospitals and delivered flowers she had helped grow to the sick. In the gardens, florists prized her budding magic that encouraged flowers to bloom boldly and swiftly, but as an adult Lyssandra chose to dedicate her powers to the restorative arts and trained with Aravia’s healers. She wished to help the sick far more directly.\r\n\r\nYears passed, yet Lyssandra never seemed any closer to graduating from apprenticeship as her peers did. No matter her devotion to learning and drive to achieve, her raw magic could not be molded into the powers of a healer. She could not mend the injured or cure the ill, and the pride her family held for her faded.\r\n\r\nDesperate, Lyssandra trained in her every waking hour and pushed her powers to their limits in the privacy of her chambers. She experimented with diseased plants and rodents. She never grew close to her desired results. Withered leaves would not rehydrate and mice would not recover their health. Her only successes remained in how quickly she could nurture a seed to sprout.\r\n\r\nThe night she had felt closest to defeat, when she was prepared to give up her dreams, was when she realized her true potential. After what felt like hours toiling over her experiments, Lyssandra stormed from her chambers to find a new specimen for her research, only to find that mere minutes had passed. Perplexed by this phenomenon, Lyssandra investigated further and discovered a pattern between her perceived time and that of others. When she focused her magic, the world seemed to slow. Or rather, her relative time sped up.\r\n\r\nSmall though her influence was on something as vast as time, Lyssandra’s powers allowed her to distort the it for herself and other living beings, such as helping a plant to mature as if a season had passed in the span of a few hours. Seeing the potential of such a gift, Lyssandra’s family encouraged her to master her abilities and focus on how they might serve Aravia on the battlefield. Lyssandra was made to attend training drills where she would extend her power to effect ranks of soldiers. She could reliably support small groups, slowing their passage of time and making them appear to their foes as dazzling blurs, or contrarily speed a foe’s relative time and trap them in languid motion to render them easy targets.\r\n\r\nGreat as this feat was, it was never enough for Lyssandra’s family. They pressed her to train harder, claiming they’d never be satisfied until she could affect an entire army’s experience of time. All save the kingdom’s ruler criticized her efforts, who watched Lyssandra’s growing power with quiet pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen skirmishes between High Elves and Demonspawn broke out along Aravia’s borders, the monarch bid Lyssandra to accompany a force of the kingdom’s finest warriors to put her abilities to the test. One did not need an army of blades when a swift, masterful few would do, Their Majesty reasoned.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of her first battle, Lyssandra was sick with fear, and her companions berated her pitiful trembling and bemoaned she would surely be a liability on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe following day, when steel clashed and bodies fell, Lyssandra wished to use her powers to flee. But when she saw a Demonspawn preparing to strike one of her companions in the back, she instead slowed the monster and shouted a warning to her ally. The warrior cut through his opponent and spun around. Before him was his attacker, seemingly all but frozen. The Elf sliced the monster in two. In that moment, Lyssandra’s strengths became apparent to her fellows.\r\n\r\nAfter every raid they were sent to quell, the warriors shared tales of how they had once feared battle, yet no longer did. They invited Lyssandra to sit around their fires at night and shared food and merriment, and trained her to perfect her fighting techniques. Soon, stories of an unstoppable Elven detachment were rife and Lyssandra had forged an unbreakable bond with her fellow warriors.\r\n\r\nLyssandra’s skills have only improved over time, and with experience she became one of Aravia’s greatest generals. A graceful leader, she does not shun the meek or cowardly, but bestows upon them a power to inspire their hearts and fight on knowing they can overcome their fears as she did. She knows that with the right support and motivation, anyone can become a great warrior.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1770#static": "Born the second son of a minor noble family from the Redspike Mountains, Errol lacked purpose in his life. Unlikely to inherit the family estates, and unwilling to make his own way in the world, he contented himself with a life of indolent hedonism, punctuated by bursts of violence toward those he felt had insulted the honor of either himself or his family.\r\n\r\nErrol became infamous for these displays of temper. The last straw came when he challenged his own older brother to a duel over a point of pride. But the duel was never to take place. His parents, at their wits' end, used their influence to secure him a position within the Sacred Order. They hoped that the Order might teach their son some discipline – or at the very least, keep him out of trouble. \r\n\r\nErrol was reluctant, at first. He chafed at the thought of surrendering his freedom to join what he saw as a humorless brotherhood of goddess-botherers. But surprisingly to all, something in the Sacred Order’s creed spoke to him. For the first time, his rank and privilege meant nothing, and he found it liberating. He had always come second in the eyes of his family, but here, at last, he could make something of himself.\r\n\r\nHe eagerly threw himself into the life of a Novitiate, and through a combination of determination and personal conviction, Errol quickly surpassed his fellows and ascended to the rank of Sergeant. It was there that he at last found his true calling; violence had always been in his nature, and he saw the opportunity to direct it toward the enemies of the Sacred Order as a blessing. A Sergeant was meant to be at the forefront of the Order’s activities, ever taking the battle to the foe, whoever or whatever they might be. In the months that followed, Errol vented his wrath against heretics and bandits. Despite his satisfaction with his new purpose, however, he yearned to do something greater – to truly prove his worth to the Order and Lumaya. \r\n\r\nTime and again, Errol, armed with unyielding faith and a sharp sword, proved himself a match for the enemies of the Order. When the Red Crusade swept across Anhelt, Errol was at its forefront, especially when rooting out any traces of the Skinwalker menace. \r\n\r\nNow a grizzled veteran, Errol led his fellow Crusaders through the vales of the Redspike Mountains, hunting down any Skinwalkers courageous – or foolish – enough not to flee. Those who sought to fight were slain outright by Errol and his followers; those who fled were hunted down like animals. Errol ordered that any villages that offered sanctuary to the Skinwalkers be put to the torch, and their inhabitants executed. Through it all, Errol’s faith in the rightness of his cause never wavered. Indeed, the greater the carnage, the mightier his sword arm seemed to become… as if he drew strength from the slaughter. \r\n\r\nSome among his followers believed this to be a sign of Lumaya’s favor; others whispered that it was instead a sort of madness. Regardless, Errol continued his march through the mountains, determined to rid his homeland of every trace of the Skinwalkers, until at last he returned to his family estates – only to find that his kin were providing sanctuary for those they saw as innocent victims of the Sacred Order’s madness. \r\n\r\nWhat followed was a tense confrontation between Errol and his older brother – now the lord of the manor – that turned to violence. It is not known who struck the first blow, but Errol struck the last, killing his brother in the same great hall where they had once played together as children. By the end of the night, Errol’s ancestral steading was aflame, and every member of his family lay dead at the hands of the warriors of the Sacred Order. \r\n\r\nErrol returned from the mountains a blood-drenched killer, empty of everything save an unshakeable belief in the rightness of his holy cause. His fanaticism was such that it unsettled even the most devoted servants of the Order, and few would willingly follow him into battle, fearing that he might turn his blade on them for their insufficient piety. \r\n\r\nAnd it was for this reason that the Arbiter, in her infinite wisdom, visited him in his quarters one night to ask him to enter a Shard. Someone so fanatical, she thought, would be a necessary weapon against enemies yet to come, and entering a Shard would keep him away from Teleria's innocents for at least a time. Errol eagerly accepted her offer, ready to wage war without end in Lumaya’s name.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1780#static": "Many are the songs sung of the Martyr of Lumaya, though few of these are what one might call cheerful. Clad in silvery mail and armed with a blade limned in holy fire, the Martyr appears in the darkest of moments, where hope is all but lost.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded sighting of the Martyr was in the Age of Hellfire, during the Second Great War. The story has become a familiar one. An embattled bastion, threatened by a horde of Demonspawn. A hopeless last stand. In the final moments, a flare of silvery light as a holy blade hacked through the ranks of the enemy, as the Martyr led the defenders in a final charge, in Lumaya’s name.\r\n\r\nThere were no survivors.\r\n\r\nNone, that is, save the Martyr, who appeared again and again, fighting her way across Teleria. Witnesses claimed that she was present for every final stand; every rear-guard action; every desperate charge. Whether this is truth, or mere hyperbole, is impossible to know. What is known is that she took part in many great battles of that age, and often was the only survivor. No matter the extent or severity of the Martyr's injuries, no matter the odds stacked against her, she fought on, as if gripped by some divine madness. Others around her caught this fervor, and be consumed by it; driven to acts of doomed courage by her mere presence.\r\n\r\nSome in the Sacred Order whispered that this mysterious warrior was nothing less than Lumaya’s wrath made flesh – that she was proof that Lumaya was not absent from this conflict; more, that she was with them in spirit, if not flesh. Such would explain her sudden appearance on so many battlefields. It was as if she were not a mortal woman at all, but instead a manifestation of holy light itself.\r\n\r\nThe Martyr’s true name was unknown. None could recall such a being within their own ranks. Those who sought her out, whether to see her for themselves or to ensure that she was what others believed her to be, claimed that she was nothing more than a mortal woman. One of great zeal and faith, to be sure, but a normal woman nonetheless. \r\n\r\nWhen the Second Great War came to an end, the Martyr vanished as suddenly as she had appeared. At least for a time. There were rumors that she had been seen here or there, hunting Demonspawn and battling Undead. But the sightings grew fewer and farther between, until they ceased entirely. Many believed the Martyr to be dead at last.\r\n\r\nThen came the Red Crusade. The Martyr appeared once more, at the forefront of the Sacred Order’s armies. Whether it was the same woman, impossible as it might sound, or someone new wielding the blade, she fought as before, with a passion that was almost madness. She slew Skinwalkers, Lizardmen, Orcs, and Ogryn with as much enthusiasm as she had shown in killing Demonspawn in the Age of Hellfire. And if some claimed that she wept sorrowfully as she fought, many in the Order said that she wept to see how the true servants of Lumaya were denigrated by their enemies.\r\n\r\nEven now, the Martyr’s true identity is unknown; indeed, some claim that she is not one woman but many – that Martyr is not simply a name or a description, but a rank. That there are many Martyrs; women chosen for the purity of their faith and an excess of zeal, to carry the light of Lumaya into the darkest of places. Others believe that when one Martyr perishes, another is chosen from among the ranks of the Sisters Militant by the Sacred Order to wield the holy blade once carried by the first woman to bear the name ‘Martyr’. They say that it has ever been thus, since the ending of the Age of Hellfire. The most persistent of the stories is that there is and has ever been only one Martyr; a soul blessed – or cursed – with eternal life. A woman placed into a Shard by the Arbiter, whose only peace is found in battling the foes of Lumaya on behalf of the Sacred Order. \r\n\r\nAs to which of these tales is true – if any – only Sacred Order or better yet, the Arbiter, knows.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1790#static": "Norog claims he has no memories of his life as a human, making him a rarity among the hybrid souls known as Skinwalkers. Likewise he professes no knowledge of his age or place of origin. Since the Skinwalker curse is fundamentally derived from the Undeath that blights Teleria, it is possible that Skinwalkers do not age, and that Norog is hundreds of years old. Those who follow Norog see him as a being out of legend – an icon, not a person. \r\n\r\nMany others see Norog as a fat, rude, tyrannical warlord, whose crimes against the holds of Frostheim and the other denizens of the Redspike Mountains stretch back to the extremity of living memory. They believe that if he is immortal, then the imperative to slay him is even greater. \r\n\r\nNorog’s gang of thick-skinned, savage Skinwalkers are pragmatically ruthless and methodically extortionate. They take relatively few lives, but have left hundreds of lives ruined. Norog himself craves not just violence but spectacle, and the infuriated embarrassment of his foes, as well as vast quantities of food and drink and regular flattering from his subordinates. Appeasement only incites further rapacity from, and negotiations with him are fruitless and usually disgusting and humiliating to boot. One secret to Norog’s success is his mysterious affinity for cold, letting both him and those in his service thrive in the wickedly frigid Redspike Mountains. Under cover of howling gales and blinding blizzards he charges into battle unhindered, his armor caked in rime and his bare pink skin radiating thick clouds of steam.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage Norog possesses is the Skinwalker curse, which he wields as both an instrument of fear and as a recruiting tool – for he has learned that sometimes his mere presence can infect. Out of those not terrified by the prospect of being afflicted, many desperate folk are tempted by the primal power even a lowly Skinwalker obtains by fusion with a revenant spirit. For some, the transformation is their primary goal when joining Norog. Others are mercenaries, cutthroats, exiles, and seekers of plunder and glory regardless of cost or morality – for them joining Norog is a means to an end. Though some of Norog’s converts have challenged Norog’s informal position of leadership, the results have only ever been blood-soaked snow and Norog giving the tedious chore of cleaning his gigantic morning star and fiendishly spiked shield to the nearest unfortunate peon in his service. \r\n\r\nAn illustrative example of Norog’s tactics and disposition is the tale of 'The Lost Eleven.' Once, a group of Dwarves struck out to found a new outpost near a rich mineral vein deep in the Redspike range. Rappelling partially down into a massive crevasse, they accessed a wall of sheet ice where they carved out a preliminary camp to prepare for the mining to come. Norog, loath to let anyone settle nearby for free, led his retinue to the site to shake down the newcomers and ascertain their worth to him. The Dwarves, having planned for hostility from the locals, barricaded themselves in their makeshift settlement and refused to treat with him. In response, Norog gathered every available member of his warband and ordered them to find the biggest rocks they could lift. Then they gathered on the glacial sheet by the edge of the crevasse above where the Dwarves had made their hollowed-out rooms to live and work in. With a thunderous series of stomps, aided by the weight of the rocks they carried, they collapsed the whole side of the crevasse. The Dwarves, their settlement, Norog, and half his followers plunged into the gleaming azure void below. Bashed and churned in the cascade of fragmenting icy shards and boulders, and finally dumped with a tremendous crash at the very bottom, Norog and most of his Skinwalker entourage somehow survived – but not a single trace of the Dwarves remained, and no Dwarven prospectors have come near Norog’s territory since.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1820#static": "The Bloodgorged no longer knows his true name, nor where he came from. Perhaps he was a paladin of the Eternal Citadel, strong and swift and bold in the defense of all that is righteous, or maybe he was a hero of one of the old Free Cities of Kaerok, or even a lauded gladiator in the Great Arena of Velyzar. Those truths have long been lost. The Bloodgorged does, however, seem to at least know his current purpose – to feast.\r\n\r\nIt can be assumed that, like all vampiric creatures, at some point in history the Bloodgorged made a pact with Siroth, sire of that particular breed of nocturns. Quite what the particular agreement was, the Bloodgorged can no longer remember, and nor does it seem to matter to him. Now, the Bloodgorged knows no master, and accepts no alliance unless it will provide him with that which he craves most of all, the blood of mortals.\r\n\r\nAll vampires must struggle with the Crimson Hunger, the addiction to life-essence that comes as a part of their unnatural transformation into deadly creatures of the night. Without regular feasting, a vampire quickly loses both their mind and much of their body, as they devolve into feral night-hunters. Some, however, become utterly lost to the craving, to the need to consume. It was into this trap that the Bloodgorged fell when he was first turned by Siroth. Despite this, whoever the Bloodgorged had been before his infection, he clearly possessed a will of iron. Driven by some unyielding desire not to submit to his fate, he battled back from the brink and recovered some precious sliver of self-control and, in doing so, a part of his very being. Drinking blood should only be a necessity, part of the process by which vampires maintain their grip on themselves - it should not, in the Bloodgorged’s view, become the very purpose for continued existence.\r\n\r\nBut the Crimson Hunger can only ever be temporarily quenched, never conquered. The Bloodgorged found that the mental effort of keeping his desires in check quickly became too draining to permanently maintain, and that resisting the Hunger caused his body to deform before his very eyes. Inevitably, and to his own disgust, he would slip into moments of hyper-violence, his rage at his failure to hold on only increasing the slaughter. It was not long before he had acquired a dark reputation even among the Undead, becoming an outcast and a wandering sell-sword.\r\n\r\nOver time, the Bloodgorged was able to slowly learn methods to use his addictions to best serve his goals and enhance his reputation, reminding himself that, whoever he had been before, he could still have an existence beyond merely satisfying the urge for fresh blood. Through the assistance of a sorcerous ally, he has managed to contain the worst of his berserk episodes via the daubing of an arcane sigil on his ashen brow. Known by the enemies of the necromantic ways as the Mark of Unholy Purpose, when applied, it helps maintain his focus, but it quickly fades, and must be painted anew with fresh blood following the next bout of killing. Between this and his own will, the Bloodgorged is yet able to maintain a tenuous grip on sanity.\r\n\r\nDespite this, to most other vampires and necromancers, the Bloodgorged is still at best an unpredictable, mercenary figure and, at worst, a deranged monster that can prove as dangerous to his allies as he can to the enemy. Only the arrogant or the desperate seek out his assistance.  \r\n\r\nWhen lost in a frenzy, the Bloodgorged becomes a nigh-unstoppable killer, a blur of constant, frenzied motion that can shatter the stoutest defense and wreak havoc among his victims. Only when he has feasted well does he become himself once again, a cold, distant light entering his wild eyes. With the Mark of Unholy Purpose freshly daubed in red upon his brow, motion gives way to brief, disconcerting stillness. To those who beg, he has even been known to show mercy in such moments, sometimes turning survivors into his thralls, though few survive the next bout of insanity.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for his assistance, the Bloodgorged requires only that he be allowed to feed, regularly and well, on the enemies he is sent against. The blood of slain warriors in particular are his favorites, for he has found that they taste the richest. This, at its core, is his greatest weakness, for while it may seem at times that he has conquered the Crimson Hunger, in reality he is as much its slave as the most debased vampiric beast. Even during rare bouts of lucidity, his only thoughts are to how he can secure his next slaughter-pact with another Undead lord and, in doing so, acquire fresh victims. Be they Elves, Humans, Dwarves or Demonspawn, mighty warriors or helpless innocents, saints or sinners or anything in between, the Bloodgorged cares not. All that matters is that he feasts.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1830#static": "Once the High Scholar of the Academy of Western Anhelt, Nethril’s life changed – and ended – forever when he made a dark pact with the God of Shadow, Siroth. For years, Nethril had been working on his magnum opus, a vast, multi-volume history of Teleria, embracing everything from flora and fauna, geography, cultures, and events, from the Gray Age to the modern day. It had become an obsession which consumed each day and most of each night, to such an extent that he sought out elixirs and spells that would supposedly allow him to live without sleep.\r\n\r\nEventually Nethril’s life began to wane, eroded by the strains of his perpetual work. It was while researching the nature of the Undead that he hit upon a realization. Time was of no concern to one already dead. Why meddle with the stopgap of petty magics, seeking to work through the night, or extend his life by only a few years, when immortality was there to be claimed?\r\n\r\nNethril threw himself into researching the Undead, delving into depths no honest scholar ever should. Eventually, having found what he sought, he took up his ceremonial high scholar’s staff and beseeched the dreaded Siroth. He presented an unusual proposition – an eternity of service if the divine would only gift him the so-called curse of the Crimson Hunger.\r\n\r\nSiroth was silent, and Nethril received nothing. He made a number of horrific attempts at gaining favor, eventually poisoning an entire cohort of new students. Finally, Siroth spoke to his would-be acolyte. The God of Darkness granted Nethril the Hunger, even going so far as to magically carve the forever-bleeding Blood Mark, one of his sigils, into Nethril’s chest. Immortality would be his, Siroth promised, in exchange for service, and a single promise – Nethril would expunge all records of Siroth from his history book.\r\n\r\nNethril agreed, and returned to his studies a changed being. No longer did the realities of mortality burden him. He had no need of sleep, nor food. He found he could work for days on end. The only burden was the need for blood, which the Crimson Hunger required if he was to maintain a semblance of his former self. He quickly conquered his desires for it. Such a craving was insubstantial compared with his addiction to his work.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement could not last. The changes in Nethril – his nocturnal habits and strange lack of appetite – drew comments from colleagues already dismayed at his unnatural work ethic. When his secret was uncovered, he was driven from his chambers, and all of his works were seized and flung upon a pyre built in the Academy’s quadrangle. Nethril went wild with fury as he saw the very reason for his existence going up in flames. He slaughtered the greater part of the Academy’s scholars, but could not save his scrolls. Drenched in blood, he took only his staff and fled.\r\n\r\nNethril swore an oath that bound him forever on the path of corruption. If the living cared so little about their own history, he would end history itself. He would help ensure Undeath triumphed over the living, and change itself would cease. Because of this, at least to Nethril’s thinking, there would be no more history. Kings would reign forever, necropolis-cities would stand as eternal monuments, and there would be no births to record, no deaths to mark. The destruction of Nethril’s work was not a loss, he realized, because even if it had been ‘completed’, it would all have been in vain regardless, as there would always be more events to record. Using this twisted logic, Nethril resolved to exterminate all life.\r\n\r\nThus has a once-great scholar become a ruthless hunter of mortals. He has fashioned his staff into the Reaping Stave, which is not only a deadly weapon, but also a powerful locus for the necromantic arts.\r\n\r\nDeath has become Nethril’s new obsession. To pursue it he has not only a razor-sharp mind and his wicked scythe, but also a bond with the creatures of the night. Swarms of bats and ravenous wolves obey his commands, helping to stalk his prey and ensuring that there is not a scrap of flesh left on bones once the killing is done, leaving the skeletal remains ripe for resurrection.\r\n\r\nNethril’s great knowledge makes him a valuable ally for other Undead. His goal is the destruction of the living, and he knows it is not something he can achieve alone. To those not battling the Undead scholar, Nethril can appear worldly and even charming, but it is a veneer covering his eternal bitterness. His twisted quest has been the cause of countless deaths, and it will continue to be so until all is as still and as quiet as the grave.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=1900#static": "Though he was born the son of Lumaya worshipers, the Elf who would become known as Ghostborn knew at an early age that he was destined for a different, darker path. He grew to adulthood on the frontiers of Aravia, an odd, sickly child among a clan of haughty aristocrats overseeing a community of Human farmers. He lacked the forceful nature of his kin, preferring his own company to that of his peers. He hid himself away, content to spend his days haunting the family library, or else sending away for books from other archives, at no small expense. The subject matter of these volumes was invariably the same; the history of Aravia, its peoples, its wars… and its religions. \r\n\r\nWhile his family worshiped Lumaya, Ghostborn had no interest in such an uncommunicative deity. There were other beings who were less remote and, more importantly, willing to talk to their worshipers. He was fascinated by spirits such as the Dreamwalker and the Lord of Fangs. But one in particular drew his interest… the fell entity known as the Heartrender. \r\n\r\nThe Heartrender is one of the more enigmatic spirits in Aravian cosmology; like the Lord of Fangs, it is not a god, but something else… a totemic ancestral spirit, revered only by certain Elven families. In return for their devotion, the Heartrender supposedly supplied them with mystic power and protection. Ghostborn’s research revealed that his family was one of those with a link to the Heartrender, though they had long since forgotten. He became obsessed with making contact with the spirit. \r\n\r\nBut in order to communicate with the Heartrender, Ghostborn needed to be able to perform the correct rites. To that end, as he grew older, he studied the mystic arts. His family, having long despaired of him doing anything useful, were pleased by this sudden change of heart. But his studies soon took a worrying turn as he experimented with ancient blood-rituals long forbidden by Aravian society. \r\n\r\nIt started small; a few drops to increase the potency of a sending. Then, the sacrifice of a small animal in order to commune with an ancient spirit bound to a boundary stone. Finally, Ghostborn took blood from one of his family’s Human servants in an attempt to bind the ghost of an ancestor, so that he could question the dead Elf on certain matters pertaining to worship of the Heartrender. This was the final straw for his family, who had turned a blind eye to his earlier experiments. Necromancy was a step too far. \r\n\r\nWhen confronted, Ghostborn swore that these indiscretions were merely harmless inquiries into a long-neglected field of study. He readily acquiesced to the demand that he cease and concentrate on more practical spellcraft. Or so he appeared to do. In reality, Ghostborn continued his experiments, and as his skill at blood magic increased, the former recluse became, to all intents and purposes, a charming, handsome example of Elven nobility. \r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Ghostborn succeeded in making contact with the object of his quest, albeit not in the way he intended. Instead, the Heartrender, or something claiming to be it, appeared to him during his daily meditations. It told him that it needed a far greater sacrifice to fully manifest… one with meaning. Animals would not do, nor would the blood of servants. Instead, he must give it the blood of those closest to him. \r\n\r\nGhostborn understood and, upon awakening he immediately set about giving the Heartrender what it wanted… the lives of his family. Ghostborn’s skill at magic far exceeded that of his kin and he soon baptized himself in their blood, as the Heartrender commanded. As it washed over him, the Heartrender whispered to him that this was but the first step. For there were others, like him, and it was his duty to see them all baptized in blood as he had been, and given over into the service of the Heartrender. \r\n\r\nGhostborn left Aravia soon after. Acting on his earlier research, he traveled to Durham Forest, where he soon tracked down more descendants of the original Heartrender worshipers and gathered them to him, using promises of power and his own eerie charm. Soon, he’d recreated the ancient cult, with all its attendant blood-sacrifices. \r\n\r\nBut if the Heartrender is pleased with this, Ghostborn can’t say, for the spirit has not spoken to him since he killed his family; a fact he has not revealed to his ardent followers. Yet Ghostborn holds out hope that his master will visit him again, if only he provides the correct sacrifice. \r\n\r\nAs such, Ghostborn and his new followers now stalk the undergrowth-settlements of Durham Forest, spreading their dark gospel to any who will listen… and claiming the blood of those who do not.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2050#static": "Roshcard the Tower, major-domo of the Sacred Order and steward of the Eternal Citadel, is a warrior of impressive height and unyielding manner. Clad in the silver armor reserved for the greatest warriors of the Order, and wielding a great, two-handed hammer, he makes for an impressive – and intimidating – sight on the battlefield. He stands head and shoulders above even the tallest of the Order’s warriors, and his size and strength make him a match for some of the most monstrous opponents. \r\n\r\nOf his origins, little is known. He was born in the Lands of Rebirth, the child of farmers who had once, perhaps, been something more. Even from an early age, his size and strength made him stand out among the other children, and he was soon hard at work in his family’s fields. By the age of ten, he was dragging a plow better than any dray-horse; at twelve, he could harvest a crop quicker than any person twice his age. It was inevitable that the armsmasters of the Sacred Order would take note of such a physical specimen, and come calling.\r\n\r\nAt the age of thirteen, Roshcard joined the Order as a Novitiate. By the age of twenty, he had become one of the Order’s premier warriors. Within a decade, he had been chosen to represent the Order as a major-domo, and after successfully undergoing a series of grueling trials to prove his worthiness, including the Test of Thorns and the Walk of Blades, he became steward of the Eternal Citadel. \r\n\r\nAs major-domo, Roshcard is responsible for the citadel’s defense in time of war, and its day-to-day operations in peacetime. If a matter concerns the workings of the citadel, Roshcard is the final arbiter. Even Eufemia Corday, the Abbess of the Sacred Order, acknowledges his authority in these matters, though Roshcard is careful not to overstep or abuse this privilege. \r\n\r\nWhile Roshcard’s rapid ascent through the ranks was largely due to both his skill in combat and his devout piety, he is nonetheless a seasoned battlefield commander. The construction and placement of siege engines and defensive works is second nature to him, and he can discern the flaws in an enemy’s stratagems simply by studying the way they array themselves for battle.\r\n\r\nOn the rare occasions his duties take him away from the Eternal Citadel, he is ever at the forefront of the attack, sharing the dangers of those under his command and, as such, is much loved and respected by his subordinates. It is said by many that, in Roshcard, the original tenets of the Sacred Order are preserved.\r\n\r\nMany are the tales of Roshcard’s heroism and determination. At the Siege of Dreadfang, he led his vanguard in an assault on the Undead forces defending the sinister fortress. When the siege towers of the Sacred Order at last reached the walls, Roshcard was first onto the battlements. Swinging his great weapon in devastating arcs that shattered bone and pulped rotting flesh, he cleared the way for his warriors to enter the fortress. And when Roshcard met the master of Dreadfang – a vile blood-drinker – he slew him with one blow of his hammer. It is said by those who witnessed the duel that the weapon blazed with Lumaya’s light as it smashed the monster’s head from his shoulders. \r\n\r\nAnother tale describes how Roshcard led the defense of the wharfs of the Free City of Ambergate from a raid by Shadowkin pirates. Why the steward of the Eternal Citadel was in Ambergate at the time is unknown save to his superiors in the Sacred Order. Regardless, he was there and, after commandeering a number of ships on the authority of the Sacred Order, organized a quick counter-attack that saw the vessels of the Shadowkin burnt to the waterline and the wharfs – as well as the merchant vessels docked there – preserved. It is claimed that he even saw to the interrogation of the few captured Shadowkin, and ensured that they were spared the Headsman’s axe in a show of mercy that few in the Sacred Order understood or condoned, but all respected. Those he spared have since become his trusted companions, and devoted members of the Sacred Order.\r\n\r\nMore recently, Roshcard has led an expedition into the haunted ruins of Narbuk, alongside the pilgrim known as Holsring the Silent. What they found there is unknown, but stories abound of a vast necropolis, home to an army of necromancers or worse. Regardless, Roshcard and Holsring were the only survivors of the expedition – and neither will speak as to what occurred there; Holsring because he cannot, and Roshcard because he has been ordered by his superiors to say nothing of what he saw.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2160#static": "Valkyrie is a fierce warrior and descendant of the Old Norr, those barbaric tribes that once inhabited Teleria’s furthest, icy north, but were scattered to the four winds by cataclysmic events of the past. Valkyrie’s people were one of many groups who settled in the Krokhan Desert, a place that was, on the surface, the very opposite of the icy lands they had once called home, yet in truth was little different. Whether the hardships they suffered were caused by freezing cold or searing hot, the Old Norr were inured to them, and they relished a place that would test their strength and weed out the weak. When Valkyrie was born, her people were as fierce and proud as the day their forebearers left their frozen fjords.\r\n\r\nValkyrie was born of a senior member of her tribe, but that counted for nothing – her upbringing was as harsh and uncompromising as that of any desert youth. The brutalities of life in the Krokhan Desert swiftly forged her into a hard and skillful warrior, and a stalwart defender of her people, and she also developed an uncompromising nature. What Valkyrie wanted, she took. Might in her view always made right, and she was convinced she was destined for great things.\r\n\r\nA being with such a mindset was destined for a shock, for there were beings and peoples in Teleria beyond the borders of the Krokhan mightier than Valkyrie’s tribe. She learned that when the Elven armies of Kephale Chassiana arrived on the desert’s shores.\r\n\r\nChassiana of Aravia was a powerful High Elf noble. Intending to channel trade from the east, she sought to to establish a colonial outpost on the edge of the Krokhan Desert. With a force of Elves and Orc mercenaries, Chassiana found an ideal location and immediately sent out cold, arrogant letters to the local tribes, demanding that they submit to Aravia or depart the immediate region.\r\n\r\nThe older heads of Valkyrie’s tribe argued that resisting an Aravian army would likely mean death, but not so Valkyrie. Scorning their lack of courage, she drew her sword and personally cut down Kephale’s messenger. That, then, locked her people on a path of war, regardless of the intentions of the tribe’s elders. Given command of the warriors by popular acclaim, she sent riders to rally neighboring Nomad clans. Almost all agreed to a temporary alliance, and for the first time in many decades the inhabitants of this corner of the Krokhan Desert set aside their differences and went to war against a common foe.\r\n\r\nValkyrie soon realized that meeting Chassiana’s well-drilled and well-equipped army in a pitched battle with her small confederation of tribes would be an exercise in self-destruction. Instead, she played to her people’s fast-moving warriors and knowledge of the terrain, conducting a guerrilla campaign amid the dunes and rocky valleys. Valkyrie and her warriors struck like a desert scorpion against Aravian outposts and convoys, melting away into the scorching heat before retaliation could find them. For months they wore down Chassiana’s control of her new territories, until finally the High Elf noble led the bulk of her forces inland to force a confrontation.\r\n\r\nThis was what Valkyrie had waited for. Her forces led the Aravians and their allies on a chase through the desert for weeks, and Chassiana’s Orc allies abandoned the cause, frustrated and hungry. Chassiana eventually found her dwindling and exhausted forces trapped between sheer cliffs and a wide expanse of quicksand. Here Valkyrie launched one final, devastating attack, destroying the Elven host. Chassiana broke out and fled to Aravia. Her reputation was in ruins, and she never realized her dreams of power and wealth.\r\n\r\nLong were the Nomads’ victory celebrations, but Valkyrie viewed them with something akin to regret. For a while the clans had known unity, but she knew that soon enough old enmities would again rear their head, and the alliance she had built would come apart as quickly as the shifting sands. She longed for the chance to lead something more potent than just one tribe.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the victory feast, Valkyrie received just that. In a waking vision, she was visited by a being of light. Calling herself the Arbiter, the being claimed that Valkyrie’s victories had been noted. Lumaya, Goddess of Light, had need of mighty warriors in the coming struggles against the dark, and Valkyrie was one such warrior. If the fierce child of the Old Norr would swear her allegiance to Lumaya, she would be granted immortality, and chance to face greater, darker foes. Valkyrie readily accepted. That night, she departed from her kinfolk, riding out beyond the desert, and into the annals of legend.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2250#static": "Shirimani was a promising researcher at the Aravian Academy of Arcana who pushed the boundaries of what was possible with frost magic. So far that she drew the attention of the Academy Elder.\r\n\r\nThe two Elves argued about the limits to which arcane knowledge should go, such that Shirimani declared her intention to leave and establish her own academy. She needed the help of no one, she claimed. All anyone else would do was hold her back.\r\n\r\nThe Elder disagreed. She warned that Shirimani’s stubborn self-belief was dangerous and would draw the ire of the monarchy. Nonetheless Shirimani, thoroughly convinced of her own brilliance, reaffirmed her intentions. The Elder conceded, telling Shirimani that she would inform the relevant authorities of her decision – and warning her that such actions in Aravia often attract unexpected and unwanted consequences.\r\n\r\nShirimani left the city and headed northward, to the stark slopes of the Mountains of Despair. Here, she found, occupied, and restored an abandoned stone fortress, giving it gleaming towers of ice, repairing its crumbling walls, and seeing it as a temple to her achievements and a testament to her bright future. She lived there in total seclusion, devoting herself to uncovering the highest forms of frost magic.\r\n\r\nBefore long, without warning or apparent reason, Shirimani’s bastion was attacked. One pale evening, a horde of beings composed entirely of flame washed over the horizon and attacked her refuge. Unleashing a dozen avalanches, Shirimani repelled them.\r\n\r\nThe onslaught was nearly too much even for Shirimani’s extraordinary power. Stubborn as she was, and loath as she was to admit even to herself, Shirimani realized her decision to set out alone may have been a rash one. She was weakened, her fortress was damaged, and she feared any future attack might be the end of both her plans, and herself. For perhaps the first time in her life, she doubted her abilities, whether she really could go it alone after all. But the moment passed, her pride taking over: she wouldn’t flee or call for help. Not until she had no other choice.\r\n\r\nThe fire-beings attacked again the following day, at the exact same time of night, but in greater numbers. Again, Shirimani beat them back. But her fortress was almost ruined, and she herself was almost spent. Once more, Shirimani considered asking for help. Once more, she stubbornly denied herself the easy way out.\r\n\r\nAs she convalesced, Shirimani pondered deeply: the same creatures, the same method of attack, from the same direction, regular as clockwork. To put those pieces together, she surmised, was to discern exactly how to stop these terrible beings. Shirimani remained in her chambers that night, wide awake and deep in thought. She recalled the Elder’s words concerning unexpected and unwanted consequences, and flew into a rage. It dawned on Shirimani that these elemental horrors were coming from Aravia. They weren't wild. They were created and directed.\r\n\r\nThe evening after her realization, the latest, and largest, invasion of the entities came. They advanced over the horizon, marching towards Shirimani’s crumbling keep like a wall of flame. This time, she was ready. She stepped beyond the mangled gateway and stood before the fire-creatures, who halted. Shirimani demanded the true architect of these attacks to reveal themselves. Silence followed.\r\n\r\nThe entities could attack at any time, and Shirimani knew she could not hold against all of them. Nonetheless, she repeated her command. Suddenly, each and every creature was extinguished as if some fire-quenching breeze had swept through them. Now only a single old woman stood before Shirimani: the Academy Elder.\r\n\r\nCalm and poised, Shirimani faced the Elder. The Elder smiled at her, and then spoke.\r\n\r\nThe Elder revealed she had indeed informed King Hatharil of Shirimani’s secession, but had recommended the monarchy allow it on one condition – that she be tested. Shirimani was stubborn, temperamental, and, ironically, hotheaded. She had run to the hinterlands without a second thought. But Shirimani was also an exceptional sorceress, and the Elder wanted to see just how exceptional. The ice sorceress had kept fighting these creatures despite the toll it took upon her, refusing to give up, and through careful analysis, found a solution to her problem. The Elder was proud. Shirimani understood. She had proven herself, not least of all to herself.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Shirimani remained independent, but maintained strong ties with the Academy of Arcana, and, in time, she transformed her fortress into a schola to which acolytes flocked from all corners of Aravia. Knowledge of ice magic in the wider realm expanded tenfold, and mages who have learned from Shirimani have used her teachings to thwart the forces of Darkness on many battlefields.",

While this penchant for insults would later serve him well, in his early life it was a liability. He frequently provoked Orcs much larger and stronger than himself, but the beatings that followed never quelled his impudent streak. Instead, each pummeling only hardened Angar's constitution and will, while pushing his sense of humor in a more gruesome and profane direction. \r\n\r\nIn Angar’s adolescence, an Orc named Bahrekk was his clan’s leader. Bahrekk was imposing, quick to anger, and even Angar didn’t dare to ridicule the Orc, who had been known to decapitate those who mocked or belittled him to his face. However, such was Angar’s nature that sometimes he could not control himself. In one instance, Angar appeared to have made a deadly error when his clan were chopping down trees. Bahrekk, working at a typically brutal pace, roared and grunted with vim and vigor with each swing of his ax. Angar did his best to ignore the sounds, but one particularly loud howl broke his resistance, and before he could stop himself he was making exaggerated groans and shouts in mocking imitation. Surrounding Orcs did not laugh. Instead they averted their eyes, for they were sure what would come next. Seizing his enormous ax, Bahrekk strode over to Angar and lifted the great weapon above his head, apparently ready to cut down the insolent Orc who ridiculed him. There was a long, agonizing pause as Angar waited for the death blow, his eyes squeezed shut, but then he heard the last thing he expected: Bahrekk’s full-throated laughter reverberating around the wood. Dropping his weapon at the younger Orc’s feet, Bahrekk declared it a fitting tool for one with as sharp a humor as Angar possessed. Angar carries that same ax to this day. \r\n\r\nAs Angar grew up, his ability to use his devilish mouth as a weapon flourished. He was equally adept at enraging a foe with barbed words as he was at smashing their defenses with his ax. One of his favored tactics is to provoke such fury from his opponents that they abandon their strategy altogether. Never was this better displayed than in his defeat of the Wyrm Knight, a famed warrior of the Banner Lords, who went to war clad in resplendent armor of crimson and gold. By this point in his life, Angar was the leader of a small clan of Orcs settled in Kaerok. They lived peacefully, and strived to ensure the surrounding villages had no reason to distrust them. This, however, did not stop the Wyrm Knight and his household warriors from riding into the Orcs' camp one morning and demanding that they leave by the next sunrise, or all be put to the sword. Angar knew his clan were outnumbered, and very possibly outmatched, but they were all in agreement that they would refuse the orders of the knight, whom they saw as pompous and vain. \r\n\r\nMorning came, and the Wyrm Knight and his warriors duly arrived. Given one last warning, Angar and his Orcs were again ordered to leave. The stream of curses Angar unleashed in refusal has become legend in itself. It is said that the honor of the Wyrm Knight's mother, sisters, and even his horse were included no fewer than seven times, intertwined with comments about the knight's ancestral armor bearing striking similarity to stinking refuse Angar had once spied in a Skinwalker dump. His family and reputation besmirched, the knight responded by dismounting his horse and challenging the Orc to single combat. \r\n\r\nThe combatants’ blows were vicious, the clash of steel deafening the forces of both sides watching on. Angar was strong and unrelenting, but the Wyrm Knight dodged each blow with supreme confidence. The knight’s stamina was impressive, but so was the Orc’s willpower. The knight sliced open the Orc’s thigh as he ducked under an almighty swing, but Angar wheeled the weapon around to punch a hole in the Wyrm Knight’s shoulder with the point of his ax. They exchanged blow after blow until finally the knight stumbled, and the Orc seized the opportunity to drive his ax through the knight’s breastplate, shattering ribs and slicing through organs. Within seconds, the Wyrm Knight was dead. Seeing their leader so brutally dispatched, the knight’s warriors promptly fled. For his victory, Angar took the Wyrm Knight’s head, to remind his enemies that his ax can always make good on the threats of his tongue.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2310#static": "The Eternal Citadel, ancient heart of the Sacred Order, is a kingdom in miniature. The mighty cathedral-fortress rises from the mountains west of Kaerok, a shining beacon to all who seek the blessings of Lumaya or the protection of her warriors. From this unassailable bastion, the Sacred Order runs its affairs on the continent of Anhelt, overseeing the innumerable convents, abbeys, hospitals, garrisons, and chapels that make up its spiritual fiefdoms. \r\n\r\nWhile the day-to-day affairs of the Order are largely handled by the Mother Superiors, and more important matters are left to the oversight of the Canonesses and Cardinals who oversee the internal bureaucracy of the organization, there must be an ultimate authority – a queen for this holy kingdom. Such is the glorious burden of the Abbess. \r\n\r\nThe first Abbess of the Sacred Order was the head of a convent of nuns sworn to the service of Lumaya during the Age of Hellfire. When the Arbiter put out her call to the faithful, the Abbess was among the first to answer. She convinced her followers to pick up weapons in defense of their goddess and their world. She herself carried a crossbow into battle, and proved to be a deadly markswoman, much to the detriment of many Demonspawn. The nuns of the other convents followed the example, and these warriors inspired by the first Abbess became the first Sister Militants. \r\n\r\nSoon after, the Abbess organized the disparate convents into a rough hierarchy, granting herself leadership both on and off the battlefield. Her efforts directly contributed to the formation of the Sacred Order, as the convents came to form the backbone of the new organization. \r\n\r\nLater, when Lumaya’s closest servants, the Lightbringers, proved too inflexible to lead the war-effort, it was the successor to the first Abbess, among others, who confronted them with the frustration of their mortal allies. The Lightbringers cared little for anything save direct battle, and their inability effectively organize logistics, and adapt to the changing conditions of the battlefield or the subtle stratagems of the enemy made their leadership a liability in the fight against Siroth. \r\n\r\nThe Abbess was among those who suggested that the Lightbringers give up control of the nascent Sacred Order, and turn it over to herself and a few trusted others. The Lightbringers agreed to resign their command for the good of the war effort, and in the aftermath of their departure, the Abbess consolidated her powers, and invested her newfound authority in her chosen subordinates. \r\n\r\nSoon, all those opposed to her were driven to the fringes of the Order. Some were sent to distant missions or remote chapterhouses, to live out their days far from the Eternal Citadel and Lumaya’s light. Thus was the Order’s future assured. \r\n\r\nThe current Abbess, Eufemia Corday, is both potentate and supreme diplomat. She acts as a counterpart to the Archbishop of the Church of Lumaya, and it is one of her responsibilities to see to the expansion of the faith, especially in regions such as Velyzar and Gloomdeep Hold – where the Sacred Order’s influence is tenuous at best – by any means necessary. \r\n\r\nWhile the Sacred Order is far from above flexing its military might to achieve its goals, the Abbess will often seek to employ her powers of persuasion as well as her political acumen against any opposition. She is adept at games of influence, playing one side against the other in order to maintain the strength of the Order in the face of its many enemies. Those chosen to take up the mantle of Abbess by the inner council are often selected specifically for their skill in these matters rather than their physical prowess. Despite this, every Abbess, including Corday, is trained in a variety of martial disciplines – including marksmanship. As part of their office, they are bestowed with the same crossbow carried by the first of their number. The ancient weapon has been well maintained over the centuries, and enchanted besides. For many, the right to carry such a weapon is all the proof of Lumaya’s favor they need – an assumption that Corday has used to her advantage more than once.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2320#static": "A Banner Lord’s secondary title or nickname, known as an epithet in the language of their chivalric code, is not merely a by-product of casual speech, but an important part of the chronicles and legacy of a leader. It is partly outside their control, shaped by public perception and the tongues of countless strangers. Knowing this, most lords make efforts to coin their own, steer any emerging trends, and censor unfavorable appellations. Despite their efforts, many lords have gone down in history with far more ignominious nicknames than Richtoff the Bold. But calling him such is, for many, more a euphemism. Stridently opposed by Richtoff and his ministers, but still commonly used, are many other epithets: Richtoff the Scoundrel, Richtoff of the Vial, and others of varying shades of vulgarity.\r\n\r\nRichtoff was a fourth son of a duke, far from any meaningful inheritance. He spent his days in leisure and at hunt with his circle of friends and flatterers. Hunting is another important part of the Banner Lords’ chivalric traditions, often seen as a way for nobles to compare prowess and contest grudges without engaging in armed conflict. Facilitating this, nobles are expected to use traditional, archaic designs of bows and spears, to ensure a fair standard of armament to judge their accomplishments by. A trophy claimed by a noble under any circumstance besides a formal hunt with traditional arms is considered no more prestigious than the carcasses produced by a common trapper. \r\n\r\nRichtoff, however, cared not one mote for this aspect of the hunt, nor in general about the glories and sacrifices of Kaerok chivalry. He used cutting-edge tools, especially the crossbow, and dipped his bolts in deadly toxins. Peasant hunters disdain poison for fear of spoiling their meat, and among lords, poisoning is generally seen as dishonorable and cowardly. Richtoff, on the other hand, only cared about dispatching his prey. He found great thrill in the chase, and showed no fear confronting deadly beasts, but he had no interest in making any battle more sporting or protracted than need be. \r\n\r\nScorned by many of his peers, Richtoff was joined by lower company on his ruthless hunts. But in time he grew more ambitious, and realized that if he gave lip service to the rules of the Banner Lords, perhaps he could engineer a rise to greatness for himself.\r\n\r\nThe duke’s third son, Gofric, went hunting with his youngest brother Richtoff when he visited him, and was appalled by his methods. Richtoff begged forgiveness and asked Gofric to return for another hunt, done properly, as an apology. The traditions were observed on that occasion, but it was marred by Gofric’s death in a tragic accident. After this Richtoff was censured by his two remaining elder brothers, Leon and Alfvar. Heretofore they had paid him little heed, focusing instead on their rivalry with each other for the position of favored heir. Richtoff told them that he was shaken, a changed man, and would be a proper and responsible duke’s son from then on.\r\n\r\nThe second son, Alfvar, died a year later, at a banquet the three surviving brothers were attending. He perished clutching his gut not long after feasting, and poison in his wine or food was blamed. Both Richtoff and Leon – now the two most immediate heirs to the estate – fell under a cloud of suspicion. But Alfvar had other enemies who could not be ruled out, and the banquet was widely attended by many other lords and their agents. No conclusive proof against either of the brothers was found.\r\n\r\nMonths passed, with Richtoff and Leon becoming bitterly estranged. Leon then fell gravely ill and lingered at death’s door for some time. Again, poisoning was suspected, but the elder brother's finest healers and magicians could not diagnose or cure whatever toxin or disease was crippling him. He survived, and made a slight recovery, but remained feeble and bedridden. In this state, he abdicated his claim to his father's title and had Richtoff formally confirmed as the heir apparent. Richtoff accepted, and his traumatized and reclusive brother has since remained quiet and compliant. Richtoff has made a great show of filial piety and lavished Leon with care, while effectively keeping him in house arrest.\r\n\r\nRichtoff’s father, the current duke, is quite aged but healthy, and Richtoff seems content remaining heir apparent and in no hurry to assume the duties of rule. He has returned to his hunts, which he now conducts according to tradition, and claimed the title of the Bold for his bravery facing dangerous wildlife. Those with suspicions, grievances, and concerns about Richtoff have their own names for him, and their own theories as to why he calls himself the Bold.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2330#static": "Robar earned his ill repute at the Battle of Three Armies. It was in this bloody clash that a host of the Free City of Danmor, the Dark Elf raiders of Hykyth Blacktongue, and the Orc warband of Skragg the Raging met. Robar had only recently come of age to join the Orc warriors in battle, and was seen a lowly runt whom most wagered would be slain by battle’s end. Little did they know of Robar's quiet eagerness for battle, and deep thirst to prove himself. He would end their doubts with action, of that he was determined.\r\n\r\nSkragg withheld his warband from the fighting between the soldiery of Danmor and the Dark Elves, his plan to strike once the two enemies had exhausted themselves. Robar was furious as he and the other Orcs watched the battle unfold, believing his great opportunity was slipping away. Without orders, the young warrior broke ranks and charged toward the two battling hosts, bellowing his war cry.\r\n\r\nMost of the Orcs were amused by this unprompted assault, and waited for Robar to be cut down by the first combatant he encountered. But from their safe and distant position they watched with surprise as he smashed down a Human knight with his mace. They watched still as Robar charged into his next foe, a Dark Elf raider, and pulverized her, too.\r\n\r\nAt first Skragg’s warriors laughed at the wild young Orc, and some cashed in on their bets. But the laughter stilled and coins stopped changing hands as Robar went on and on, slaying each foe in his path. Elves and Humans fell beneath his bloody mace as he waded deeper into the melee. From their station the warriors who had mocked him began to murmur their support, and then to roar it, invested in and amazed by the youth’s mad show of defiance.\r\n\r\nDriven into a frenzy by Robar’s display, the warriors surged forward to join him, crashing into both opposing armies at once. Skragg tried to hold his warband back, but to no avail, and watched as the Danmor and Dark Elf armies broke and ran, blindsided by the sudden aggression of an enemy that had seemed content to wait out the contest. Confusion and panic reigned and, by the time the chaos had subsided, Robar stood alone amidst the carnage, the captured great-standard of Danmor in one fist and the severed head of Hykyth Blacktongue, in the other. From that day forth, none questioned Robar.\r\n\r\nAs Skragg’s campaigns continued, Robar's star rose further. He proved the Battle of Three Armies was no fluke, cementing his reputation as a mighty warrior, and neither armor nor magics were adequate protection against his mighty, relentless blows with his infamous mace, Skullshatterer. It was not long before he earned the position of Skragg’s closest personal guard and warrior, with the task of finding the foe’s best fighters and crushing them into the dirt.\r\n\r\nWhile Robar might have continued in this role for the rest of his days, fate had other ideas. Before long, Skragg began to fear that his most prized warrior might usurp him. The warlord considered ways to remove Robar but knew he would need the help of assassins from afar, as none in his own warband would dare raise a weapon against this mighty Orc whom all admired and feared in equal measure.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Skragg did not need to go ahead with his scheme, for Robar discovered it. Skragg expected that his favorite warrior would slay him for his duplicity. Instead, Robar loudly defamed Skragg before the warband, admonishing him as an insecure and weak-willed wretch. In truth, Robar had never intended to use his popularity to unseat the warlord and seeing now just how weak the warlord truly was, Robar departed, intent on putting his warlike talents to use for stronger and more appreciative masters. In the years since, he has found no shortage of those, for Teleria is almost always in a state of conflict and now as much as ever, a strong arm and fighter’s skill is in high demand.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2350#static": "The being now known only as the Soulless was once known as Sir Ector. A stern and strong knight of the Free City of Delanos, Sir Ector became a member of the Cult of K’Leth during its early years and rose quickly to the inner circle of the Knights Revenant. Though not a cruel or vindictive man, Ector believed in the hierarchical nature of his society and that low-borns should know their place, a stance that made him a natural fit among the higher ranks of the Cult.\r\n\r\nFor hundreds of years Sir Ector lived as a Knight Revenant, his soul being transposed into a new body as the last grew old, sick, or battle-injured. A tireless warrior, Ector was regarded highly by his fellow Knights Revenant – not only for his skill in combat, but for his generalship and strategic wit and vision. Often the first choice as leader when the Cult of K’Leth was forced to do battle, his rise to prominence might well have continued were it not for the infamous Battle of Mournsorrow. The Aravian authorities learned that the Cult had made the forlorn site, in an untamed land, a stronghold, and dispatched a force to drive it out. Their attack came at the time when a number of Knights were going through the critical stages of a soul transposition ceremony. Sir Ector was among them. Cultists fell to Elven spears and swords. Elves were hacked down with Cult axes and cudgels. Were it not for the ruthless cool of the Soul Shepherd leading the ceremony, who rallied the Cultists and organized the defense against the surprise attack, the Elves would surely have been victorious.\r\n\r\nDespite the Cult's victory, the damage done by the interruption to Ector and the other Knights Revenant was devastating. Caught during mid-transference, their souls failed to lodge properly in their new host bodies. The other Knights Revenant perished, but Ector clung on to life, a sliver of his being having successfully pierced the essence of his new host. But while he was able to draw slowly back from the brink of death, he found himself forever changed.\r\n\r\nSir Ector was no more. Most of his soul was gone. He had only the vaguest memories of his past, just ghostly half-recollections that he feared were mere products of his imagination. From that day forth, the Knight Revenant once known as Sir Ector became known as the Soulless.\r\n\r\nThe draining of so much of Ector’s soul has left little of the former man behind. But some still remains: his disdain for those he considers his lessers can be heard in his miserable ramblings, and he has lost none of his combat prowess. Even so, his existence is one with little emotion, a gray and desolate realm of which he is a lonely king. Free of emotion, immune to pain, and protected by his heavy enchanted armor, Ector is immovable on the battlefield, and he gives his mountain-like defense a wicked edge with the hacking of his great war ax.\r\n\r\nThe bitter existence of the Soulless is alleviated only when he can claim the souls of others, often in the midst of battle – then he can experience second-hand those last fleeting sensations of raw emotion, potent draughts of fear and terror. In an effort to feast on these feelings and regain the emotions he has lost, he distorts soul gem magic to snare and imprison the souls of his foes into his weapons and armor, snagging them during combat and storing them up to experience their feelings at his leisure. Their tormented agony is still visible in the warped faces and clawing hands that adorn his shield and breastplate, their horror-stricken images feeding the Soulless and reminding him that, against the odds, he still lives and can still feel. The spirits he binds within his armor fade over time, and so the Soulless finds himself on an eternal quest, collecting the darkest of emotions as he tries in vain to fill his meaningless existence.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2360#static": "Elenaril still wears the gold and purple regalia awarded to the highest servants of Aravia, but she is one of the most infamous and despised traitors in the kingdom’s history. For decades she has been a thorn in the side of the Aravian monarchy, ever since she betrayed her covenant with the crown and went rogue in spectacular fashion.\r\n\r\nWhy would the monarch’s chosen high master archer, respected and laden with accolades, abandon all this to take up a life of subversive rabble-rousing? Some say she was kidnapped from birth by some arch-conspirator such as a Dark Elf or a necromancer, and brainwashed to become a sleeper agent. Others even claim she is a magical shape-shifter – they struggle to conceive of a true-born Elf harboring such treachery. Others say she always was a citizen of Aravia, but fell to some sort of corrupting influence. Perhaps it was Demonic whispers, or a foul tome containing secrets that warped her mind. The Dark Elves, and their seductive cult of the Dreamwalker, are another strong possibility. Others cite more mundane sources of indiscretion such as bribery or blackmail, or even that most treacherous of emotions, love – for someone with radical beliefs, or for a radical cause.\r\n\r\nAll that is certain is that after working her way to the very top ranks of the Royal Guards, Elenaril stole a collection of scrolls and manuscripts from the royal library, as well as the beautiful and valuable wargear of her rank she had been granted from the royal armory. By the time the thefts were discovered she was gone, and had somehow circumvented the magical wards and psychic taboos placed upon all high-ranking servants of the monarchy as a precaution. The mage who cast those spells, and who thus failed to control Elenaril, was tortured nearly to death, but had no explanation for his otherwise sterling magics failing thusly. He currently rots in a dungeon, still under a cloud of suspicion.\r\n\r\nAs for Elenaril, she went to ground for years, seen and heard by no one even as Aravian spies poured across the countryside and ventured abroad in search of her. Her bounty of stolen secrets never turned up in the hands of Aravia’s enemies nor anywhere else. Why she stole what she did, and for whom, comprise yet more of her dire tableau of mystery. One scholar, asked for his opinion, posited that the only being powerful and obscure enough to be Elenaril’s master, and thus the recipient of the secret documents, is the Arbiter herself. The court did not find this suggestion humorous, only for the scholar to stammer out that he was serious, soon after which he excused himself.\r\n\r\nYears later, Elenaril resurfaced. She appeared before a gathering of Ogryn on their way to serve at Felwin’s Wall accompanied by a small detachment of Aravian soldiery, and hailed them in a mighty voice. She told them they were trudging toward a long and ignominious downfall, toiling as second-class citizens to defend a fortification that never should have been built. She decried the Aravian monarchy and all it stood for, proclaiming that the High Elves in their arrogance were inviting the wrath of the Goddess. A day of judgment would soon come upon Aravia and all who stand with her, when the residents of the kingdom would be forced to choose between their cruel and haughty masters and a war of liberation that would usher in a new golden age. Before she could be apprehended she struck down several pursuers and vanished yet again, her speed and agility too much even for the High Elf guardsmen chasing her. Since this dramatic re-emergence she has repeated this stunt in various other labor camps and mustering-grounds, always preaching radical liberation and the overthrow of the Aravian crown. \r\n\r\nSome superficial parallels exist between Elenaril and the pair of malefactors known as the Winged Elves of Felwin. A well-respected High Elf overseer was seduced by – or chose freely to follow – a Dark Elf infiltrator who possessed inexplicable powers of flight, and together they repeatedly flout the restrictions on passage across the Wall for reasons unknown. Though they are not thought to be working directly with Elenaril, she may have been inspired by them, and they are likely on friendly terms. The Royal Huntsman has made careful note of all Elenaril's past associates and paid each a visit, as well as mapped all the places she was known to frequent before her betrayal and where she has since been sighted. She will need all her guile to evade this most mercilessly patient of warriors, and even then, a duel between these two deadly archers seems only a matter of time.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2370#static": "As some in Teleria like to say, the only things taller than Turvold’s stature are the tales told about him. Quite where he comes from no one in Teleria can say with absolute authority, though his mighty horns, huge build, and incredible strength all lend credence to the claim that he is certainly no mere mortal. According to Turvold himself, he grew up among the Old Norr, that boastful race that once inhabited the frozen north of the world. Most claim that he is the son of a union between a Norr hero and a giant, which would go a long way to explaining many of his characteristics. Certainly, he seems to have inherited the Old Norr’s legendary proclivity for drinking, boasting, and adventuring.\r\n\r\nGreat swathes of Teleria’s population, from Anhelt to Peltas to the Lost Isles, have heard of Turvold, dragon-slayer, mountain-conqueror, the mighty half-giant. In Aravia, the saga-weavers who serve the High Elf monarchs recall how the hulking barbarian came to the aid of an Elven mage beset by a wicked Demonspawn of Siroth. In a desperate bid to see her protector victorious, the mage cast a spell of unyielding strength on Turvold’s sword arm, its after-effects still visible in the arcane blue energies that yet suffuse the stony skin there.\r\n\r\nIn the dismal swamps of the Sorrowlakes, Lizardmen talk of how Turvold once got into a headbutting contest with an Ogryn warlord during the height of the Gaellen War. The warlord was beaten, but refused to concede, so Turvold headbutted everything the Ogryn held dear, most specifically his hoarded trophies and grand hall. By the end, his possessions were in ruins, Turvold’s formerly straight horns had a distinct bend to them, and the warlord was acknowledging his inferiority.\r\n\r\nIn western Anhelt, jesters in the service of the Banner Lords and troubadours traveling between the Free Cities have perhaps the most stories about Turvold. Their accounts range from the time he was hired by one vainglorious noble to watch his expensive carriage during a grand feast – Turvold wrecked the vehicle after taking it for a wild, drunken ride over a cliff and somehow survived unscathed – to the time he was accused of stealing gold from a shrine to Lumaya by a particularly zealous member of the Sacred Order. Turvold responded by bashing in the knight’s gold-plated armor and then, after the knight had discarded the then-useless equipment, donating it to the Church of Lumaya. \r\n\r\nEven among the followers of Siroth, there are stories of Turvold’s greatness. In one tale recounted by apprentices of a number of dark sorcerers and necromancers, Turvold once slew a servant of Siroth who was in the process of raising an army of the Undead. For some reason, one particular skeletal knight refused to collapse following the necromancer’s destruction, and instead followed Turvold wherever he went, unwilling to acknowledge that he was already dead and pleading with Turvold to turn him into a mighty warrior. Supposedly, Turvold did just that.\r\n\r\nThe tallest of tales mostly concern Turvold’s sword, a vast wedge of tempered steel and gold finish that is almost the size of an ordinary man. Perhaps it was forged by an Elven smith whose family Turvold saved from bandits, or was given to him by a knight Turvold rescued from a landslide, having held back the collapsing slope single-handedly while the man escaped. One of the most enduring accounts holds that Turvold acquired it after he battled the great dragon, Kuldath, atop an erupting volcano called the Thundermount, in the heart of the Deadlands. He wrestled the monstrosity, so it is said, matching the creature of Siroth sinew-for-sinew, eventually strangling it with his bare hands. Afterwards, he found a sword that had been lodged in the fire-monster’s flank and had come free. Turvold recovered it, and has wielded it ever since.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that not one of these stories is true, though many likely have their origin in reality. Regardless, while some may scoff and claim no one could possibly achieve such feats, few indeed are those who would defame Turvold to his face. The barbarian is a mighty warrior and fearless adventurer in every sense and, despite his great age, he still claims that his best escapades are yet to come.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2390#static": "Before the Kingdom of Kaerok there were the Free Cities, fiercely independent and proud. Sethallia, ruler of the Free City of Landsrell, was more farsighted than most. She had served as an envoy to the Elven nation of Aravia and seen what their tightly unified kingdom had accomplished. She had read the histories of the ancient Dragonkin Empire and learned of the centuries of peace and plenty that had come from their centralized rule. While the tyranny of the Dragon Emperors repelled her, she concluded that they became tyrants due to preventable factors. Her interpretations were colored by her sharp distaste, expressed only privately, for the other Free Cities and their lords, who cared more about personal status and grudges than the common good. She believed a lord’s notion of commonweal must extend not only to their subjects, but to their rivals’ subjects, for the people of Kaerok shared so many cultural and spiritual bonds. The freedom of the Free Cities she saw as foolish, for the price of their freedom was division and thus weakness.\r\n\r\nA series of catastrophic events proved some of the merits of her views. A Free City was nearly destroyed by rampaging Skinwalkers. Later, disaster unfolded at the Council of Narbuk, a conclave intended to ease tensions and mend rifts between branches of the Church of Lumaya. Sethallia, always a believer in unity, listened eagerly for news from the Council, expecting a new age of peace and tolerance to emerge. Instead, a chaotic schism unfolded when certain delegates were allegedly assassinated during a recess after one heated exchange. Hardliners from the Sacred Order and the Free Cities took control of the Council and declared, among other strict and inflammatory decrees, that Skinwalkers were to be universally abhorred and destroyed as servants of Darkness. In the wake of this, savage purges occurred all over Kaerok. Sethallia had always sympathized with Skinwalkers, viewing them as victims of a curse and not monsters, and was disgusted by the Council’s verdict. But her voice of calm and reason was not enough to control the rising tide of hatred. While blood flowed in the streets and the lords plotted how best to exploit the chaos for their own gain, Sethallia saw even greater troubles brewing and prepared Landsrell for long years of hardship, stockpiling grain and recruiting troops. Others called her paranoid.\r\n\r\nSethallia was right again. The repercussions of the debacle at the Council took time to propagate, but like an avalanche triggered by a distant quake, backlash was inevitable. The Council’s verdict had been an affront to the Church in Frostheim, which had long ago integrated Skinwalkers into their canon, deeming them part of Lumaya’s divine plan regardless of the origins of their curse. The Free Cities found themselves under lightning attack from the north as Frostheim warriors and their Orc auxiliaries poured across their borders. The lords of Kaerok’s Free Cities were largely unconcerned with culture and politics outside their realm, and so failed to realize exactly how high the tension on their border had been ratcheted. They paid dearly for this.\r\n\r\nAs the northernmost cities fell, many lords saw the chaos as a gainful opportunity. Many paid off the invaders, creating a bidding war whose loser was overwhelmed and sacked without assistance from the others, enriching and empowering the Frostheim coalition in the process. The Free Cities were defeated in detail, and Sethallia’s warnings finally gained credibility. The lords styled themselves knights, but they had no leader to rally them all together and direct their strength toward the true threats that surrounded them. Long and grinding years of war and raiding passed while the Free Cities slowly coordinated a coherent defense. Landsrell, fortified and prepared, withstood wave after wave of attacks, proving to be a keystone in the defense of the realm overall. If Sethallia’s realm had fallen, the unity of the others would likely have disintegrated and Kaerok as a polity would have ended then and there. Instead, she endured, rallying support from the flagging lords, until the man emerged who godfathered the Kingdom of Kaerok as a new political entity: Acelin the Stalwart.\r\n\r\nIf Acelin, first King of Kaerok and Knight of Knights, was the godfather, Sethallia must be accounted the godmother. Due to the evolving contours of the war she could not coordinate extensively with Acelin, and met him only once, at his coronation. But she was one of his first and greatest advocates. Respected for her foresight, she helped justify Acelin’s growing consolidation of power. Acelin went on to unite the Free Cities and drive the Frostheimers back, establishing borders of Kaerok that have persisted more or less unchanged through the present. He later entered into a political marriage as part of the process of rebuilding Frostheim and Kaerok’s relationship – a fact that was said to have left Sethallia quietly heartbroken.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2440#static": "There are many hunters in the Kingdom of Aravia but only one can bear the title of Royal Huntsman, and it takes no small amount of skill and dedication to claim it. Masters of archery and stealth, they are expected to carry out some of the monarch’s darker orders without question, in service of the realm. For this reason, the Huntsman’s golden helmet is a sight that discomforts many in the palace of Aravia. If ever an enemy of the crown needs to be reminded of the ruler’s power, or if an overly loud dissenter needs to disappear, the Royal Huntsman is sent to climb through their bedroom windows at night to leave a message, or to send an arrow through their heart from atop the palace’s spires.\r\n\r\nLittle is known about the current Royal Huntsman, only the stories and rumors that circle him and the fact that he has held the position for over a century. If pressed on his identity, he gives the name Melatheril, though whether it is true or false remains unconfirmed. In common gossip, it is believed he came from humble birth and that his family name, or lack thereof, is a source of embarrassment to him. It is undoubtedly true that his identity being hidden benefits him in his role, but some speculate that he has renounced his name, either to fully embody the duties of the Royal Huntsman without sullying himself, or to abandon a shameful past.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most infamous of his rumored deeds was the first task supposedly given to him by a past Aravian king. This ruler was a powerful seer and had a vision of rebellion and a crumbling kingdom at the hands of a fair maiden. Hunters from across the land were hired to find and kill her. While others scoured city underbellies and criminal hideouts, Melatheril, a hunter then of little importance, discovered the Elf woman living a peaceful countryside life, having never made any advances against the crown, and with no apparent intentions of doing so. Melatheril took out her heart and delivered it to his liege regardless.\r\n\r\nIn some iterations of the tale, the maiden was the crown’s rightful heir and was murdered by an usurper before she could raise a rebellion against the false ruler. In others, she was an innocent beauty who became the target of the monarch’s jealousy. No matter the version of the story, the Royal Huntsman’s role remains one of a brutal, remorseless killer.\r\n\r\nMost stories of Melatheril’s service share the same dark endings of slit throats or arrow-riddled bodies, but these have become fewer and farther between in recent times. The Royal Huntsman’s dark robes have been replaced by regal golden armor and his official duties now align more with those of a soldier and bodyguard, rather than those of an assassin.\r\n\r\nIn battle, the Royal Huntsman lurks between ranks, identifying enemy commanders from afar and plucking them off one by one with his bow. It is said that he can shoot a moving target from across a battlefield and have a fresh arrow nocked and ready before his last finds its mark. Should the city of Aravia ever be sieged, the Royal Huntsman will take up his post at the top of the palace’s highest tower where he can oversee the city in its entirety. With his keen eyes, he can spot all threats advancing through the streets and rain down arrows upon them before they can reach the palace gates.\r\n\r\nWhen not on campaigns, Melatheril can be seen among the royal guard patrolling the palace, but his unyielding loyalty to the crown sets him above even the steadfast custodians he walks among. Besides being an unyielding sentinel, he is the liege’s prime servant – fast, efficient, and unquestioning in his work. As a result, he acts as a royal messenger trusted with the most secret missives, as well as a spy capable of intercepting enemy communiques and relaying captured intelligence back to the palace.\r\n\r\nThough publicly the Huntsman's role has changed, his underlying threat remains. It is disconcerting to many High Elves how the kingdom’s laws bend around Melatheril’s methods. So long as his missions are completed, the crown appears to care not about the means. And though these acts are conducted in the dark and concealed from most outside the royal court, the rumors that surround Melatheril and his long absences from the palace leave many suspecting his activities. As much as the crown may wish to promote a gracious and noble front, their diligent Royal Huntsman can always become their arrow in the night should the need arise, a chilling thought for many in the Aravian court, and the very reason why so few can meet the Huntsman’s eyes without shuddering.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2530#static": "Ogryn are a naturally self-reliant people. Some Ogryn are quite happy alone, others in small groups. Tribes of Ogryn, however, are not uncommon, especially in the more inhospitable parts of Peltas. Such communities fought hard in the Gaellen War, and many served the Gaellen Pact. But loyalty to the Pact among the tribes is not what it once was, and many tribes now make war against their former allies. One of these is the Irontusk Tribe, and they are led by the fearsome Ogryn known as War Mother.\r\n\r\nWithin Ogryn tribes, elder females often receive great respect as rulers, advisors, seers, and healers. Few, however, combine so many of those roles as War Mother, for to her people she is all these things. The Irontusk Tribe is one of the most brutal and militaristic Ogryn groups to be found in Peltas, and under her leadership they intend to become the most powerful of all Ogryn tribes.\r\n\r\nWar Mother is descended from a long line of Ogryn warrior-women. According to the stories of the Irontusks, she was the seventeenth daughter of Gramar the Prodigious, the matriarch of the powerful Bonegrinder Tribe. The Bonegrinders were wiped out almost entirely during a Sacred Order crusade, but Gramar and a number of her offspring survived. According to the bone-tally lineages kept by the tribes, Gramar was herself the seventh child of Bruzor the Most Prodigious – though she is reported to have eaten at least one of her siblings. Bruzor was a senior commander within the Gaellen Pact, and famously carved a swath through Anhelt at the height of the war. Thus War Mother is the descendant of some of the mightiest Ogryn of recent centuries. Some say that she has the ability to foretell the future, though only after particularly immense feasts, while others say that she is a cunning alchemist and potion-forger. According to the boldest Ogryn, she seeks to build a legacy that will rival that of her grandmothers, uniting the tribes in the strength of the whole, rather than through the prowess and gut-size of any one individual. Her role in creating such a future goes unquestioned by the Irontusks for, as they are fond of saying, 'War Mother knows best'.\r\n\r\nA point of great curiosity, at least among non-Ogryn, is the creature strapped securely to War Mother’s broad back. It is quite clear that whatever the thing is, it is no Ogryn. Small, weak, with vestigial horn-nubs and fangs and wide-open eyes, it seems out-of-place among the hulking brutes that comprise War Mother’s extended family. Some say this impish creature – no true child at all, but known as the Horn-Son – is a spawn of Siroth, and certainly on first glance it seems likely. No one knows where it came from, but anyone who knows of it knows to treat the Horn-Son with the utmost care and respect, lest they incur not only War Mother’s wrath, but that of every Irontusk.\r\n\r\nAccording to the tribe, the Horn-Son is the very personification of war itself, a creature given flesh and form by the raw, destructive power of the Ogryn when they seek out conflict. For now it is small, just like the Irontusk Tribe. But they will grow, swelling their ranks with new recruits and their lands with new conquests. With every new foe that is pulverized or consumed, they say that Horn-Son’s stature and power will also grow, until he is ready to ascend as a new demi-god of devastation, and the leader of both the tribe and all of Ogryn-kind.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2550#static": "Altan is a Jotunn of fire. The Jotunn are a rare species, for they are slow to breed and solitary by nature. They are commonly associated with cold and mountainous areas, because their extraordinary physiology can withstand the frigid temperatures. In fact, their tolerance for harsh environments extends to other extreme habitats as well, and Jotunn such as Altan sometimes reside in scorching climes. \r\n\r\nOn the eastern edge of the Krokhan Desert lies the rugged Dawnmounts range, and among its peaks is an active volcano whose flanks are barren slopes of superheated ground, dotted with fumaroles. Known to the Krokhan Nomad clans as 'Red Grandfather' for its magma and ruddy, mineral-rich rock and soil, Altan made it his abode long ago: unsure of where to settle, he carved divination runes into a fallen tree-trunk and then hurled it into the air, and decided his course based on where it pointed when it fell, and what runes were visible. \r\n\r\nOver centuries of life on the volcano’s slopes, Altan’s body adapted to the blistering heat and noxious fumes, his skin becoming as crimson as the mountainside. He would often stare for days on end at the mesmerizing sight of the slow, bubbling flows of lava, searching for mystic insights in the patterns of glowing red molten rock and darker, cooling stone. He raised totems of obsidian daubed with volcanic mud, to honor the fire spirits he felt certain dwelled within the mountain. By these esoteric practices, he cultivated a great magical affinity between himself and the forces of fire and lava. He grew to need food and drink but little, meeting his needs with infrequent expeditions into the desert or the adjacent mountains where wild sheep and yak might sate his hunger. \r\n\r\nThe local Nomad clans only encountered Altan on those rare occasions when the Jotunn ranged from his home, every so often down the generations. Tales of Altan spread, especially at inter-clan moots where Nomads from different regions compared their sightings. In time they recognized that these glimpses of the red giant were clustered near the volcano called Red Grandfather, so the Nomads associated the two. They began to call Altan the Jotunn by the name Red Grandfather as well, and see him as the volcano’s guardian and personification. \r\n\r\nAs knowledge of Altan spread across Krokhan, brave folk attempted to search for his home on the slopes of the Red Grandfather. Many tried and never returned, but the Krokhan Nomads persisted, until eventually Altan came across the ragged remnants of an expedition that had ascended his sulfurous peak in search of him. They were on the verge of death, succumbing to the vicious heat and searing vapors, but they did not die. Old Altan restored them to life, channeling an ancient healing warmth he had gleaned from his long days of meditative communion with the fiery heart of the mountain. He was not so hermetic as to let them die to preserve his solitude, and he was curious as to why they had braved the brutal volcanic conditions. \r\n\r\nAltan drew a magic circle to protect the Nomads from further suffering in the heat. Conversing with them, he learned that he was known among the Krokhan peoples. He was intrigued and felt a faint, satisfied pleasure learning that he was an object of fascination and mystery. Altan bade the warriors return home and recuperate. He told the Nomads that if they wished to come back and speak again, they should spend more time training and adapting to the harshness of the fumarole-fields, so that they could better tolerate the volcano and thereby begin to understand its power and wisdom as he had.\r\n\r\nThe Nomads returned home and spread the news of their encounter. Within a year, an encampment of warriors, shamans, mystics, and folklorists had formed at the foothills of the Red Grandfather. Seekers of knowledge and wisdom would ascend as high as they could bear, as the heat and number of sulfurous vents increased with altitude. Day after day they trained their lungs to cope with scorching air, and their bodies to shed the terrific heat. They found that the higher up the slopes of the volcano they could climb, the likelier they were to be visited by Altan. The fire-Jotunn would praise the supplicants for their effort and impart some of his wisdom before sending them back to cool down and reflect on their sufferings and their newfound insights. By this ascetic practice of mortifying their bodies with the volcano’s heat, fighters claimed to acquire incredible toughness and stamina, and sages were said to experience visions and strokes of genius. The practice became a local spiritual institution, and Altan a quasi-religious figure, himself the Red Grandfather of the volcano.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2560#static": "Orcs have always been known as beings of strong emotion, a fact that other peoples sometimes struggle to appreciate. Aware of this, the wisest Orc leaders seek the aid of a caste that have grown as the influence of other races has become more prominent in Orc culture over the centuries. Though calling themselves the Shamans, a title used by peoples throughout Teleria, these Orcs are different than others known as such for they have a skillset unique to their kind – mastering their strong emotions and channel them into sorcerous energies. Their self-control and wisdom has seen them acting as advisors for the Orc clan leaders of Peltas in particular, many of whom struggle to find common ground with other peoples who do not appreciate the forcefulness of Orc emotions and view their race as unpredictable and aggressive.\r\n\r\nThe Shamans in particular put emphasis on harnessing what they saw as specific positive emotions, such as determination, courage, and hopefulness, believing they could lead their kindred to a higher plane of enlightenment if these became dominant characteristics of the Orc mindset. However, the caste split with members who believed that only by accessing the full range of emotions, including anger and hate, could Orcs reach their full potential. This breakaway faction called themselves the Seers and, while they began as rivals, the two groups soon came to work together, joining a third faction of Orc spiritualists, the Bonekeepers. Shamans, Seers, and Bonekeepers remain as magically-adept advisors in many of the more traditionalist clans.\r\n\r\nIn recent times, one Shaman in particular has risen to prominence among the caste, Valga Redmane. She and her two sisters, Vorag and Enga, each displayed magical aptitude from an early age, but divergence in their natures saw them bound for different paths. Valga, who was courageous, fiery, and good-natured, earned the favor of the local Shaman while Vorag – quiet, calculating, and ruthless – attracted the attention of her clan’s Seers. Enga, quiet and morbid even as a child, came to the attention of the Bonekeepers. The triplets took oaths to the separate castes, and were thus divided.\r\n\r\nValga served for some years as the Shaman advisor to the Orc chieftain Skaldran, until his assassination by Dark Elves who blamed him for the recent torching of a part of the eastern reaches of Durham Forest by Orc raiders. Falling out of favor with the rest of the clan after Skaldran’s death, Valga hired out her magics and her knowledge, working as the unlikely advisor to the Kaerok lord, Stonetower. While many in Stonetower’s domain complained about the presence of an Orc in a position of power, Valga proved herself when she healed the noble’s son from a deadly bout of bog fever.\r\n\r\nValga’s loyalty and abilities were proven again when she negotiated the withdrawal of a migrating Ogryn tribe from Stonetower’s territory without recourse to bloodshed, and when she led an extended series of bargaining that saw Dwarf merchants from Gloomdeep Hold establish a trading outpost within the province.\r\n\r\nDespite her talents and wisdom, some still question Valga’s motives for remaining in Human-dominated Kaerok, where she continues to suffer the ire of both commoners and other nobles who do not share Stonetower’s views. There are claims she is actually searching Kaerok and wider Anhelt for her sisters. Her ambition is to reunite with them so they might combine their power, each learning the ways and secrets of the others to create a trio of monumentally powerful and enlightened Orc sorceresses.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2600#static": "Ignatius is an Ogryn unlike any other. While as strong and resilient as many of his kind, his essence has become fused with something more, something primordial and igneous. The story of how this came to be has its roots in Peltas, amid the desolation and heat of the Dawnmounts.\r\n\r\nOnce, Ignatius was a warrior of Aravia, guarding Felwin’s Gate. For all the fighting involved, such a static existence did not appeal to his fiery and adventurous spirit, and when a famed Elven adventurer named Adrion put out a call for recruits to join him on an expedition, Ignatius transferred and joined the Elf, as the only Ogryn in the party. Adrion intended to make his fortune by seeking out the artifacts left by the slain foes of Korax, a great, semi-mythical Demonspawn. His band ventured from Aravia to the Deadlands, where they began the arduous trek across Peltas to Korax’s supposed lair, in the heart of Mount Cinder in the Dawnmounts. Legend had it that Korax had long since been bound there by a Lightbringer who had almost vanquished the Demonspawn before he escaped to the mountain’s depths.\r\n\r\nThe party arrived, exhausted, and entered a labyrinth of tunnels leading through the heart of the mountain itself. It fell to Ignatius to ensure their survival, who smashed through rubble blockages and threw his smaller companions across fissures. Seemingly against all odds, they worked their way to the core of the mountain and discovered what they had yearned for – a cache of ancient, sorcerous tools, tomes, and weapons, once borne by those the Demonspawn had slain down the centuries.\r\n\r\nSo that part of the legend was true. However, Korax had not been bound by a Lightbringer, and was merely slumbering. Awakened by the presence of souls disturbing his fastness for the first time in decades, Korax roared with blazing fury, flooding the tunnels with fire and immolating most of the party as they tried to make their escape. Ignatius was able to haul Adrion free before the others were destroyed by the flames, but both survivors were burned, the Elf particularly so. Despite Ignatius’ efforts, Adrion perished.\r\n\r\nIn the novel position of being smaller than his adversary, the Ogryn took to the lesser tunnels to avoid the hulking Demonspawn. The flames had seared away his weaker companions, but Ignatius’ flesh was tough as iron and almost as unfeeling, and he carried on. With Korax failing to reach him but relentlessly patrolling the larger tunnels, the Ogryn lived for months in the mountain’s warrens, subsisting on underground springs and moss while he sought a way out. His body steadily adapted to his new environment, helped on unintentionally by the magical elements of the Demonspawn’s fire, his welts and burns forming new tough, craggy flesh not so dissimilar to Korax’s molten hide.\r\n\r\nHaving spent so long failing to find a means out of the mountain via the smaller tunnels, Ignatius resolved to cease his attempts at escape. He instead determined to take the fight to Korax, for continuing to run and cower felt shameful. When he was certain Korax was hunting for him elsewhere, he entered the main chamber at the center of the mountain and sought a weapon among those left behind by the Demonspawn’s defeated foes. He unearthed a great mace of fiery rock, which he named Magma, as well as scraps of armor and equipment, and met Korax head-on. The Demonspawn was weary from his hunting and burning out so many of the mountain’s tunnels, but even so, the clash between the pair lasted hours and shook Mount Cinder from its peak to its roots. Finally, with one almighty blow, Ignatius swung Magma and pulverized Korax’s horned skull.\r\n\r\nThe Ogryn rejoiced, but felt no desire to return to his dull existence in Aravia. The flames of Mount Cinder had burned deep not only into his flesh but into his very soul, changing him and, in a way, binding him to it. Ignatius chose to remain, making a stronghold in the tunnels and using Korax’s hide and bones in the construction of a grand hall. Stories told by desert Nomads and Velyzari merchants about a mighty flame-wreathed Ogryn who was said to spit lava and crush Demonspawn spread like wildfire across Peltas, and he became a legend, as renowned as the Demonspawn he had slaughtered. Other Ogryn sought him, and now an entire tribe inhabits Mount Cinder, a gathering of craggy-skinned, kindle-eyed brutes. Perhaps Ignatius will be content to remain in his new home, or perhaps he is building his strength, and one day his new tribe will march forth and carve a place in the wider legends of Teleria.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2710#static": "Longbeards are among the most exalted commanders of Skinwalker forces, and the Gaellen Pact relied on these forces extensively during the Gaellen War. To be named a Longbeard is to be given a position of great military authority and some minor political influence as well. The title symbolically represents both the length of their service and their impeccable grooming for the position. A Longbeard often cultivates the long beard called for by the title, even though, as with the other ranks inspired by Skinwalker physiology, it is not a requirement. Women instead grow long hair to weave into splendid braids. Even in small ways such as this, Longbeards hold themselves to a famously high standard in all areas of life. \r\n\r\nWhile the other Gaellen Pact races of the Orcs, Ogryn, and Lizardmen are all formidable foes, Skinwalkers have a unique combination of physical and psychological power on the battlefield. Not only are most Skinwalkers larger and stronger than an average Human, they bear a dreadful but inevitable side effect of their transformation: they can spread the Skinwalker curse. That means that everyone, friend or foe, must fear attracting their ire. By means that few Telerians completely understand, a wound dealt by a Skinwalker can sometimes be a conduit for a spare lingering corrupted animal soul to enter the victim. And that makes Skinwalker regiments an absolute terror. Even if it never comes to pass, the mere possibility of one’s stricken comrades becoming mindless, rampaging, newborn Skinwalkers is enough to break the will of soldier and commander alike. And should it come to pass, havoc is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThis is a dangerous game, for such a newborn Skinwalker is a menace even to its own sire. The Skinwalker armies must maintain ironclad discipline to stop the very nature of their curse from creating too much chaos to manage. New Skinwalkers, former foes taken from the battlefield, typically must be press-ganged into service and forced to find new loyalties in their life. Prejudices against Skinwalkers are rife everywhere but the Sorrowlakes, so the fledgling Skinwalkers usually feel – or are made to feel – as though they have no home to return to anyway. To create a strong community structure, there is great honor and dignity accorded to the traditional ranks of authority in the Skinwalker armies, from the lowest ‘Hoofmate’ who commands five to eight comrades, to the ‘Five-Claws’ commanding several Hoofmates and ‘Many-Teeth’ who in turn manage Five-Claws. There are ‘Graymanes’ who are wise tacticians but no longer capable of direct fighting, and ‘Snarlers’ who act as military police and all-purpose disciplinarians. These terms drift over time and vary regionally, confusing outsiders. They are not literal and do not prescribe certain features to the Skinwalker who holds a given title, but rather they are symbolically descriptive of the appointee’s role in the great pack.\r\n\r\nThe Longbeards are one constant across all Skinwalker forces, however. They are the high council of the Skinwalker military and each is the pinnacle and the pride of their particular division of troops. Some who serve under them might surpass them in raw might, or in strategic or tactical acumen. But Longbeards are perfectly tutored, trained, and practiced in both, so that they may be the best leaders on and off the battlefield overall. They are given knowledge of potent battle-rites and totemic rituals reserved for those who have proven themselves wise enough to deploy them responsibly. One famous example is known as the Crack-Bone Song, Curse of Frail Prey, or ‘brittleness curse’, that saps strength and vitality. Their authority on any particular matter they care to weigh in on, within the ranks of their legion, is law. They are the ultimate deterrent for any troublemakers. Should any branch of the Skinwalker military seem to be growing out of control, or to be responsible for atrocities beyond the pale, the Longbeard at the top of its hierarchy will be held accountable by the combined might of all the other branches.\r\n\r\nOne Longbeard called Jargrunn became renowned as the exemplar of the Longbeard way. He led a portion of the final, suicidal defense of the City of Dreams as the armies of the Telerian League closed in, buying time for refugees to escape. Jargrunn commanded such loyalty and respect that volunteers flocked to his banner to stay behind and fight to the last, even knowing their deaths were nigh-assured. By this stage, the desperate Gaellens had been deploying frantic and poorly-trained Skinwalker recruits, so the Telerians were impressed by Jargrunn’s unexpectedly high standards of leadership and discipline – so impressed that they spared him and his holdouts from the expected massacre when what was now called the City of Lost Dreams finally fell.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2720#static": "Hakkorhn Smashlord was a signatory to the Gaellen Pact, helping ensure Skinwalkers a place and a voice within the multicultural proto-nation emerging in the Sorrowlakes. That Pact would launch a long and bloody war of revenge, and continue to shape world politics to this day.\r\n\r\nBut before Hakkorhn was the Smashlord, he was a young Nomad leading a meager life of subsistence at the edge of the harsh steppeland of the southern Stormwind Wastes. He was clever and ambitious, and no role his tribe offered could truly satisfy him. Restless and ill at ease, everything changed when he had a life-changing encounter with a Demonspawn, a being of smoke and whispers with the skull of a yak for a head, whose body flickered with flame and black soot. This Demonspawn, whether self-taught or infernally tutored, knew all about the Skinwalker curse, and the power of revenant animal souls.\r\n\r\nThe Demonspawn could easily sense the desires and frustrations raging within the man before him, and as the young Hakkorhn stood frozen in bewilderment, the Demonspawn whispered that the change he sought would visit him, and he would have no choice but to eat its heart and be born anew, or else perish. Having spoken, the Demonspawn faded like a mirage, leaving Hakkorhn deeply confused and disturbed. The man tried to put the encounter out of his mind, but as the days passed, his dread and curiosity grew.\r\n\r\nHakkorhn was still far from any town or hamlet when he saw the outline of a huge bovine creature on the horizon. As he drew closer he saw that hellfire was in its eyes and its horns, pointed toward him with murderous intent, gleamed. He considered running, but knew he’d never match the beast's speed, so stood his ground. A brutal struggle followed, in which Hakkorhn’s cunning prevailed, and he laid low the raging bull. Exhausted and fearing corruption and death as the beast’s foul blood soaked into his own grievous wounds, Hakkorhn heard the words of the Demonspawn echo in his mind. Maybe fulfilling its covenant would save his life. He tore through the creature’s flesh, wrestled out its still warm heart and bit into it, just as the Demonspawn had told him to.\r\n\r\nHakkorhn twitched, Hakkorhn bellowed. His skin ripped and reformed and he felt as if he was being turned inside out as coarse hair burst from his skin and horns erupted from his skull. In lurches and lunges his physiology took on that of the creature whose heart he had eaten. His soul was battered and his conscious mind fled.\r\n\r\nWhen Hakkorhn awoke, he was still on the steppe but with no familiar landmarks to orient himself. It was then that the Demonspawn appeared again. It provided him with food and drink, and told him much of the lore of Skinwalkers. It taught him to master his powerful new body, and gifted him a wickedly spiked hammer bigger than any Human could wield. The Demonspawn led Hakkorhn across the Stormwind Wastes, showed him strange relics and sites of lost potency. It instructed him in rhetoric and oratory, on how to lead and how to rule. Rites of weal and woe were revealed to him, powers to heal and harm.\r\n\r\nFor his part, Hakkorhn played the part of the eager apprentice but he never truly bowed in good faith before the Demonspawn. When he felt he’d learned enough, he declared his ties broken and left. Judging its work to be complete the Demonspawn let him, telling Hakkorhn to grow mighty and wanton, and water the furrows of history with blood.\r\n\r\nBut though Hakkorhn was mighty, he did not grow wanton. He had been a proud man and did not believe that true greatness could come from life as a mere rampaging vagabond. After departing the Wastes Hakkorhn soon encountered a pack of Skinwalkers heading for the Sorrowlakes. Something incredible was happening there, they said. A society was being built, one in which their kind could live without fear of murder or oppression, and which unified Ogryn, Lizardmen, and Orcs with them. He joined the group, eager to be a part of such a grand project. He soon earned the moniker ‘Smashlord’ for the way he pulverized raiders who attacked his pack. After they reached the Sorrowlakes, Hakkorhn's learned charisma rapidly gained him an immense following of Skinwalkers, and he came to lead dozens of clans. When Rhazin Scarhide proposed the Gaellen Pact, Hakkorhn joined without hesitation.\r\n\r\nHakkorhn did indeed make history, and watered its furrows with blood, but he also brought great power and dignity to his people, who had suffered decades of brutal persecution. The morality of the Gaellen War will always be contested, but it is never said that Hakkorhn was any agent of Darkness – his story shows that no matter their dark origins, Skinwalkers choose allegiances of their own.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2750#static": "The role and title of basileus has not been used by the High Elves in centuries. It was adopted only by monarchs, signifying their duty to lead armies into battle from the front and their willingness to die alongside their soldiers if required. Few individuals known as the basileus died a peaceful death and, after the Age of Hellfire, in which many such monarchs were slain, it was decided to no longer use the title. The potential instability the untimely death of a king or queen in battle could cause was great indeed, and it was something the royal family and nobility of Aravia no longer had appetite to risk. Lonatharil was the last basileus.\r\n\r\nWhile ruling Aravia, Lonatharil longed to have songs sung of his exploits. He wished to be immortalized in marble, lauded like the heroic basileis of old, and then idolized by his successors. He spent every waking moment training his body and mind to be like the rulers of yore – such as his hero, Roanas, who left to serve Teleria eternally as part of the Arbiter's host during the First Great War. While Lonatharil's predecessor was known as the Great White Eagle of Aravia, he was called the Black Hawk. Clad in gilded armor of midnight sable, he would strike down all those who threatened his kingdom with a sword as keen as a raptor's talons, while wearing a crown of gold.\r\n\r\nIt was not long into the young Lonatharil's reign when he was faced with a test worthy of his hero. During the Second Great War, Siroth opened portals from his realm of Anathraad, allowing his Undead and Demonspawn legions to invade Teleria. Even the Arbiter was shocked by the sheer size of Siroth's armies, and realized she and her forces alone could not push back this threat. She called for aid.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Arbiter's call reached Aravia, Lonatharil sprung into action, mobilizing the kingdom's armies. Having read the stories of Roanas' gallant host and his legendary speeches, Lonatharil addressed his hastily assembled forces with much pomp and pageantry. He tried desperately to emulate Roanas' grandeur, repeating phrases the basileus used that he had committed to memory. It took word of the ripping open of reality near Aravia's eastern border for Lonatharil to break his sermon. Without a moment’s hesitation, he ordered his armies march to counter the forces of Siroth.\r\n\r\nWith Demonspawn and Undead pouring into his realm, Lonatharil led his forces straight toward the portal, throwing all caution and strategy to the wind. During the battle, the clash of flesh, steel, and sinew was brutal, with the High Elves fighting with unyielding determination and discipline. Remembering how Roanas flew like a great eagle into combat, Lonatharil spurred his horse toward the opening of the hellmouth and leapt into the melee, falling upon his foes like the great Black Hawk he styled himself as. He cut Undead and Demonspawn to ribbons with his blade, and his warriors were inspired by their ruler's courage. They surged forward, pushing Siroth's forces back. As the fighting raged and blood spilled, the ferocity of Lonatharil's battle cries put fear into the hearts of even the most fearsome Demonspawn.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of fighting, Siroth's invading force had been defeated, and Lonatharil stood before the portal as his mages weaved coils of magical chains to close it. His golden hair was matted with blood, and his once gleaming blade was now dark with the viscera of slaughtered Demonspawn. Letting out one final war cry, he collapsed to the floor, tears rolling down his face in dismay. Lonatharil felt empty. While he had achieved all his hero did, why did he not feel fulfilled? Why did he feel scared? Then he realized. The Arbiter had come to claim Roanas for her own. There was no sight of her. What had he done wrong? He was ashamed. He had only been lightly wounded, surely that meant he had not fought hard enough. He was not worthy of praise.\r\n\r\nLonatharil took a dagger from a slain foe, and sliced it through his wrist. In that moment, as his life force ebbed away, the Arbiter came. Before he died, she took his willing soul into a Shard, just as she did with Roanas. Lonatharil’s surviving soldiers cried tears of joy at the sight, and ever since, the High Elves have sung of their fallen leader's unfaltering bravery, of how he defeated a fell host of Demonspawn and Undead.\r\n\r\nMuch as they do with Basileus Roanas, the people of Aravia hope that Lonatharil, their Black Hawk, shall return, and that his talons shall rip out the corruption that has befallen Teleria in the ages since the Second Great War was fought.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2800#static": "Lowly acolytes of the Cult of K’Leth speak of the 'Priests of Immortality', those who they know to be important figures in the Cult’s rituals of soul transference. To the Knights Revenant, these beings are known by their true name – Doompriests. And as their true name belies, Doompriests are not the saviors the lesser cultists believe them to be. \r\n\r\nThe magics involved in shifting souls from their hosts to soul gems are far from easy to master, and as the Cult grew, the need to harvest bodies for the Knights Revenant overwhelmed the capacity of the small number of Soul Shepherds. In an effort to maintain a constant supply, they agreed to teach the art of transference to a few trusted initiates who they came to call Doompriests. But the Soul Shepherds kept for themselves the art of transferring souls from gems into bodies, thereby protecting the most crucial half of their arcane knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo the majority of the Cult’s flock these 'Priests of Immortality' are the heralds of their long-awaited reward – the start of their journey to eternal life. But the Doompriests and the Knights Revenant they serve know that very few soul gems go on to have their precious contents transferred into a new body.\r\n\r\nThe hierarchy among the Doompriests remains opaque, but it is believed that foremost among them is Lady Klaxis, and the story of how she became so says much about the Cult's shadowy practices.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of a wealthy and greedy merchant, Klaxis was sidelined by her father whose chief concern was trade and business. With financial ties to the Cult of K’Leth he had come to know that coin alone could not buy immortality, and was easily recruited. Having been promised that he’d be swiftly granted a new physical vessel, he happily volunteered to give up his own. Though the ritual in which his soul was extracted should have been secret, Klaxis had followed her father and watched from a hiding place as the Doompriest transferred his essence into a soul gem. She was discovered, taken prisoner, and forced to work for the Cult.\r\n\r\nWith her father’s soul entrapped, Klaxis had nowhere to go and no one to help her, and so she remained with the Cult, doing what she needed to to survive. She earned her captors' trust and learned their ways, years later grasping the Doompriests' power. She was permitted to assist with soul transference ceremonies and later was accepted into their ranks. She made close alliances with a number of prominent Soul Shepherds, inveigling herself into the role of first among equals and making herself indispensable.   \r\n\r\nKlaxis has since found herself in possession of the glinting soul gem that holds her father’s essence. Having power over the man who had once had power over her seems to her a fitting irony. But how she will use that power remains to be seen. Will she seek the forbidden knowledge that will release her only relative? Or keep his soul as a trinket, a reminder of how far she has come?",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2920#static": "There are stories told between the people of Frostheim of a monstrous Ogryn who lives among the heights of the snow-clad mountains they call home, a stamping, iron-clad brute who commands the winds and the ice, and whose fate is therefore inextricably linked to the very future of those bleak peaks. These tales are sometimes confused with the legendary Ice Golem who, in the ancient stories, wrecked the Winter Hall and slaughtered the kings of old, though in reality they are two very different beings.\r\n\r\nThe Ogryn is Gurgoh the Augur, and the stories all agree that he is the only child of a warrior and a powerful ice sorceress. Not only is he an Ogryn of great intelligence, but he also possesses an instinctive ability to command the forces of the place where he grew up, the gales and snows of the Redspike Mountains. This elemental magic is something even skilled sorcerers struggle to control, but he was taught by his mother to slowly master it, and she scribed the runes of protection and guidance into shards of mountain rock that he still wears around his neck.\r\n\r\nAs he approached adulthood, Gurgoh began to experience unusual dreams that his mother believed to be visions. He witnessed strange lands and cities unknown, but was at a loss to interpret them. Often he saw a great orb of metal, and at other times a lonely hut perched on the edge of a cliff somewhere in the mountains. Perhaps, with time, his mother would have been able to decipher Gurgoh’s prophecies, but she never had the chance, for both of his parents were killed during a rockslide, proof that these peaks are a dangerous place even for those who bear their magical essence in their veins.\r\n\r\nDistraught at his parents’ death and now viewing the snow-bound slopes of Frostheim as a place of sorrow that he would have to endure alone, Gurgoh chose to set out into the world. He served for many years as a warrior, first among his kind, in Aravia, where he helped to guard Felwin’s Wall and became particularly infamous as an adversary among the Dark Elves, and then as a roving mercenary across Kaerok. During that time he amassed for himself a heavy suit of scrap armor and a small fortune.\r\n\r\nHis visions continued. As they intensified, Gurgoh found himself unable to ignore them any longer. He traveled back to Frostheim, building a cabin for himself high in the most inimical peaks. Having spent much time among the other peoples of Anhelt, he now found value in the solitude he had once known in the mountains, and sought a return to that reclusiveness as he pondered out the meaning of his existence. He expected to find a measure of peace, but instead his prophetic experiences grew even stronger. Images of the metal orb in particular became more and more insistent. The artifact seemed to lie in a desolate ruin that, from the stories his mother had told him, Gurgoh assumed to be the remains of the fabled Winter Hall. He scaled all the way up to the ancient stronghold, evading the Ice Golem at its heart by infiltrating its lower levels. With his magical talents he cast aside the feet-thick snow that covered entrances cracked open by the elements over centuries.\r\n\r\nGurgoh discovered the royal treasure of the ancient kings of Frostheim at the heart of the hall's ice-clad vaults, the great orb among it – a part of a king's scepter. He returned home and, still guided by his visions, carved runes of snow and sundering into the metallic sphere before forging it into the head great mace, which he named Frost Bearer.\r\n\r\nFor a while Gurgoh’s visions were quelled, but soon he began to experience something even stranger. Despite his isolation, other Ogryn braved the elements and sought him out. They claimed to have seen him in dreams of their own, dreams that foretold that he would one day unite them as a new and mighty Ogryn tribe that would rule the Redspike Mountains.\r\n\r\nAt first Gurgoh refused to entertain such ideas, for he had never sought personal power. Still, he could not deny that his auguries had thus far come true, and that he had recovered an ancient symbol of Frostheim kingship. It was not long before he too saw visions of his future self, ruling over a new kingdom of ice, stone and steel. As more Ogryn are inexplicably drawn to what is rapidly becoming a stronghold high within the Redspike Mountains, the Humans of the kingdom are taking note, many considering the influx a potential threat. What remains unknown even to Gurgoh himself is whether he is in control of events, or whether his fate has already been chosen for him.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2950#static": "Among many other damnable titles, Cruetraxa is known as the Mother of Blades, Queen of the Infernal, and the Unseeing Eviscerator. She is a Firstborn Demon and, if the stories are to be believed, one of Siroth’s oldest and closest confidants.\r\n\r\nAfter Lumaya's abandonment of the Dance of Darkness, Cruetraxa was among the first to urge Siroth to take up arms and assert his superiority. Among some Firstborn it is claimed that she had a hand in the origins of the primordial dispute, though that is false. Whether it is a lie spread by Cruetraxa’s enemies to undermine her standing and characterize her as a treacherous schemer, or one spread by her allies to further show her favor and influence with the great Siroth is unclear – perhaps it is both.\r\n\r\nCruetraxa is said to have surrendered her sight to prove her loyalty to her god, a sacrifice that elevated her to her lofty position. Such influence, however, comes with a less obvious cost. Cruetraxa's position is eyed by countless others. Down the ages, Cruetraxa has turned her potentially precarious position on its head by casting herself as a Demonic matriarch, a mother-like figure and, at times, a kind of consort to Siroth, who has long seemed willing to indulge Cruetraxa’s Firstborn eccentricities in exchange for her fanatical commitment. She has taken on the role of adviser to many lesser Demons and Demonspawn – they venerate her and seek her counsel and favor, believing that with it they will have a more direct link to Siroth himself.\r\n\r\nCruetraxa encourages this, offering much wisdom and assistance to those craving her guidance. Those selfsame Demonspawn find themselves indebted to her, but such is Cruetraxa’s subtlety and artfulness in the game of Anathraad politics that many only realize they have become her pawns once it is already far too late. Just how much influence Cruetraxa really has with the Shadow God can never be proven but, by characterizing herself as his most favored, she has helped ensure her position is rarely challenged, an unusual thing in the dangerous realities of Anathraad.\r\n\r\nWhile Cruetraxa has worked carefully to play the part of the matriarch of Demon-kind, her manifestations in Teleria are anything but tender and motherly. When the self-styled Queen of the Infernal marches to war, she often does so with a retinue of sycophants and Demonic courtiers. Such devotion to her even extends to other devotees of Siroth too, whether vampire, necromancer, or other, for the support of the infamous Mother of Blades is sought after by any kind of Siroth’s followers. Many are the Demonspawn who would sacrifice the bodies they have stolen to enter into Teleria just to secure a one-time audience with her.\r\n\r\nCruetraxa has warped her host body into an appearance that is as beautiful as it is deadly, though always she remains sightless, her senses attuned to her surroundings in other, unnatural ways. As with that of many Demonspawn, the slender body Cruetraxa has claimed belies the unnatural strength that is at her command. Wielding her favored weapon, the multi-pronged glaive known as Soulspitter, her blows have the power to pierce castle gates and punch through the breastplates and bones of a half-a-dozen knights at once. The tendrils that adorn her head, each as sharp and armored as the rest of her form, dance and weave around her as she fights, often as dangerous to her allies as they are to the enemy, even the tiniest cut or nick inflicting terrible pain. If wounded by them, only the most foolish of Demonspawn would complain, for it is better to be in Cruetraxa’s deadly presence and injured than cast out from her unnatural sight and her favor unharmed.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=2980#static": "Kantra the Cyclone is a figure straight out of the old songs. Even a novice bard knows enough tales about her to keep a crowd entertained all night, and still have hours of material left unsung long after the inn doors close. She epitomizes the ideal of the Norr shieldmaiden, with incredible strength, courage to the point of arrogance, and a mouth more foul than a Sorrowlakes saltmarsh. For all that, few realize that the real Kantra the Cyclone is no Norr at all – but a Human born in the Free City of Tilshire.\r\n\r\nKantra's family were wealthy merchants, having made a fortune supporting ocean trade between the Elven kingdom of Aravia, Velyzar the Arena City, and the rest of the world. While nominally independent, Tilshire's extreme proximity to Aravia gives the Elven kingdom huge sway over the Free City's politics, and Elven fashions are followed by the city’s elite, Kantra's family no less than any other. They expected her to grow up to be a woman of grace like her sisters, with refined tastes akin to that of an Elven maiden. What her family got was anything but – Kantra was rambunctious, combative, and untidy. Her family tried for years to secure a profitable matrimonial match, but Kantra scared off – or assaulted – any suitor who they considered. Giving up any hope for their daughter, Kantra’s family sent her off to the Tilshire Merchant Marines. A wise choice for them, though it would inflict Kantra upon the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThough the training for the Merchant Marines saw Kantra's combat skill develop, her muscles harden, and her ax-arm strengthen, she chafed under the harsh discipline of a ship at sea. She was almost grateful when a vessel of Norr raiders attacked her ship. While she fought valiantly, Kantra was overwhelmed and taken prisoner, along with the rest of the surviving crew. Impressed with her prowess in battle, as well as the coarseness of her language, the raiders offered her a place among their ranks. Given the opportunity to escape her rigid life in the Merchant Marines, and live a life of true adventure, Kantra agreed with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIt is from there that the tales of Kantra begin in earnest. They speak of an eye lost in a bar brawl. Bounties on her head from every corner of the world, from Delanos to Yakai. An ax won from a Demonspawn prince, whom she stabbed with a blade concealed in her wrist-guard. A shield once carried by a captain of a Skyiron Navy frigate, which she stormed single-handed. She is said to have lovers of all kinds in every port in Teleria, and ten times as many enemies. Kantra became known as the Cyclone because her ferocity matches that of a storm.\r\n\r\nThat Kantra has become a sword-vassal of the Arbiter herself is a surprise to exactly no-one who hears of it. She has done everything else – so it is only natural that she would pledge herself to save the world. What other way to best the stories already told of her?",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3000#static": "The icy Winterlands that lie north of the continents of Peltas and Anhelt have been mostly uninhabited for more than a thousand years. The old Norr settlements from the Age of Hellfire have been buried by snow and ice since the people who built them were driven south by Demonspawn invasions. Some say that a Lightbringer lives there, a servant of Lumaya who watches the world from his great snowy hall, deep in the evergreen forests. Some call him a powerful warrior, who strides into battle with a holy sword and smites Demonspawn and Undead alike with righteous fury. Others call him a savior and rescuer, who brings food and warmth to any in Teleria trapped in cold mountains or harsh winters. Regardless of his titles, all of them know him by the same name: Sir Nicholas.\r\n\r\nActs of charity and protection are repeated throughout all of the many tales of Sir Nicholas. Every culture of Teleria tells them, from the Shadowkin of Yakai in the east to the kingdom of Frostheim in the west, and in every tale he is beloved. Not every account is true, but that hardly matters to the man himself – so long as they are stories that keep hope alive in dark places, he is satisfied.\r\n\r\nNot everyone is so comfortable with such tales. The Sacred Order regards Sir Nicholas as a fantasy. They deny the accounts and evidence, and pass their disbelief down to the millions that must obey their edicts. One must ask, when faced with such ardent denial, why the Sacred Order draws such a hard line about a figure who would appear to be their ally. The answer? Shame.\r\n\r\nSir Nicholas is real, and always has been. He was once a part of the Sacred Order, and known for being a jovial Lightbringer who had a tendency to leave gifts for those he met. But in the days leading up to the Red Crusade, as the Sacred Order prepared its rhetoric against the Skinwalkers, Sir Nicholas saw the writing on the wall. He could not condone the persecution and slaughter he was convinced was coming, and so, one night, he left.\r\n\r\nWhile Sir Nicholas might have been the first to leave, he would not be the last. The brutalities of the Red Crusade were too much for many of the faithful, and there was a grand exodus from the Order’s ranks. But, of all those who abandoned the Sacred Order, the scar left by Sir Nicholas’ disapproval cut deepest among the Order’s magistrates. He had been loved by everyone. Some thought him too soft to fight the war they were fighting, but none of them ever could claim that his kindness was wrong. And so guilt and shame drove them to erase his memory, to destroy his legacy as completely as they could. Sir Nicholas could not outshine the righteousness of the Sacred Order if he did not exist at all.\r\n\r\nSir Nicholas outshone the Order regardless. He has never stopped seeking out those in need, even from the grand lodge he built for himself in the Winterlands. When he found too few to help in his icy home, he obtained an enchanted sleigh with which he could fly out over the rest of Teleria at night, searching for desperate folk in need of a savior. On Yuletide celebrations, he often visits the largest cities of Teleria, depositing bountiful gifts for those who deserve them.\r\n\r\nStories of Sir Nicholas cannot help but remind people of the value of the smallest act of kindness. For all the treasures he gives, it is his kindness that makes people love and believe in Sir Nicholas. And it is that love and belief that inspires such jealousy in the modern Sacred Order – true adoration cannot be earned at swordpoint, but, without Sir Nicholas and those like him, swords are all the Order has left.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3170#static": "Narbus and Kiro Drexthar were two knights of the Free City of Kalmar. Twins by birth, they shared a deep and personal bond. They won their spurs together, fought their first battle side-by-side, and even married their sweethearts on the same day. Their harmonious kinship was often contrasted with the discord displayed by their cousins, Eronn and Harren Inithwe who, though also twins, quickly became infamous throughout Kalmar for their bitter rivalry.\r\n\r\nHarmonious though the relationship between Narbus and Kiro was, the vagaries of their lives eventually brought about a rupture. Narbus was struck down with foulflesh, a festering and deadly plague that swept through southern Anhelt and reached Kalmar. Almost half the city's population perished. As his brother lay on his deathbed, Kiro silently promised that he would not allow Narbus to pass so soon. In desperation, he sought out Kalmar’s court sorcerer and demanded, at sword point, that he aid Narbus. The sorcerer did what he could, but refused to dabble in dark magics. Kiro, however, had no time for such self-restraint, whether his or anyone else’s.\r\n\r\nThe twins had recently helped in the defeat of a Demonspawn infestation in Kalmar's northern marches. The Demonspawn's leader had been taken prisoner, and was still in the dungeons of Kalmar Castle. Kiro received dispensation to visit him and, in secret, pleaded for help in saving his brother. Sensing an opportunity to spread Siroth’s corruption to the stricken mortal, the Demonspawn was only too happy to teach Kiro the rites necessary to reach out for the kind of help Kalmar’s sorcerer would not supply.\r\n\r\nKiro performed the rites, and Siroth answered. He promised not only that Narbus would survive the foulflesh, but that he would live for at least as long as Kiro would, so Kiro would not have to experience the pain of life without his twin. In exchange however, Kiro had to promise his soul to Siroth, to serve him faithfully, if not now then at the point of death. Ever-willing to make sacrifices for his brother, Kiro accepted.\r\n\r\nNarbus did indeed recover, and life went on, until the fateful Battle of Anstrast. An Orc drove its spear through Kiro’s side, leaving him lingering on the point of death. Narbus was distraught. That night, alone in his tent, waiting fearfully for news from the physician, Narbus prayed to any being who would listen, pleading for his brother’s life to be spared. Unfortunately for him, Siroth was the only one listening. Not knowing that his brother had already made a secret pact with the God of Shadow, Narbus begged him to let Kiro live. Narbus swore to serve the god when the end of his life came.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the day of reckoning arrived. A terrible fire took hold of Kiro’s manse while his brother was visiting. While they succeeded in saving each other’s families, the twins were trapped in the burning building. Realizing that there was no hope of escape, Kiro admitted what he had done to Narbus. With horrid realization, Narbus said that he had done the same. Too late, they understood the trickery at play.\r\n\r\nAs the flames rose to claim them, each prayed for the other to be spared, but Siroth only mocked them for their foolishness. He would have them both. As the fire burned their flesh, they were transmuted together into a single Demonic being – in his amusement, Siroth melted their fire-scorched souls together, creating the creature which became known as Drexthar Bloodtwin.\r\n\r\nTransmuted into a being of flame, the twin consciences of the bound brothers have long since melded into a single mind. Drexthar raged against his fate, but all of Siroth’s toys submit to the god eventually. The former twins are now as much a warrior of the Shadow God as any other Demonspawn. Drexthar is now a hunter of mortals, the dreaded Master of Fire and Ash, his fate used by Siroth as an example of the Shadow God’s power and cunning. He finds no solace that his bickering cousins, now known collectively as Inithwe Bloodtwin, suffered a similar fate.\r\n\r\nAt one forever with the flames that ended his mortal existences, Drexthar is a blistering force on the battlefield, his scorched plate armor and molten-hot essence repelling the most determined of attackers. He is bound for eternity to follow Siroth’s commands, and even if he was not, he likely still would, for he knows that the Shadow God will always have his way in the end.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3180#static": "Inithwe Bloodtwin’s fate was sealed long ago, with a rivalry that became infamous throughout the Free Cities. Once, the Demonspawn was two beings, identical twin brothers named Eronn and Harren Inithwe. Both were knights of the Free City of Kalmar, and both despised one another with a passion that bordered on insanity. All they shared in common was their looks, and their hatred of their cousins, the harmonious twins Narbus and Kiro Drexthar.\r\n\r\nThe twins’ rivalry had been strong since birth. As children they scrapped incessantly, their trouble-making so unrelenting that their parents considered giving both away for adoption to separate families. It was easy to confuse the pair, and there was no graver insult to either.  While he was a surly teenager, Harren was enraged by one such incident. He took up a kitchen knife and gouged a long scar down the left side of his face to mark himself out from his sibling. Harren’s act of defiance only angered Eronn, who was upset he had not thought of proving his hatred of his brother by scarring himself first. With the same knife he slashed the right side of his face.\r\n\r\nEndlessly competitive, both brothers sought to become knights of the Lord of Kalmar. It was said that the ruler of Kalmar only accepted both as warriors because he was afraid that, if one received the honor and the other did not, the one left scorned would kill him. \r\n\r\nPerhaps, with age and time, the ferocity of Harren and Eronn’s rivalry would have cooled. Fate had other ideas, however. It was seemingly inevitable that the twins fell in love at the same time with the same woman, one Lady Beatrice. This fresh feud was dangerous enough, were it not for the fact that, unbeknownst to anyone in the Free City, Beatrice was secretly a Demonspawn of Siroth, an ancient evil known in Anathraad as Apraxis.\r\n\r\nThe fact that both twins had fallen in love with her was no coincidence. Their spitefulness had caught even the attention of the Shadow God, and he wished to amuse himself at their expense. Beatrice played one off against the other – insomuch as it was even necessary to do so – and fanned the flames of their disputes. The divide grew so deep that both were soon plotting to murder one another, though they knew they could never succeed and still win Beatrice’s hand, for their rivalry was so well-known that if any harm befell either in Kalmar, the other would immediately be implicated.\r\n\r\nFor years, the twins’ anger and bitterness led the pair down the path of darkness. With Beatrice’s subtle encouragement, Eronn and Harren went further. They both reached out to dark powers in an effort to break the deadlock. Each swore an oath, unaware that the other was doing likewise, that they would serve the Shadow God for eternity if they could likewise be the one to enjoy Beatrice’s hand in marriage for all time as well. Siroth accepted.\r\n\r\nThe bargain was soon completed. During a campaign in the icy Redspike Mountains, both brothers succumbed to the chilling cold. As death loomed, they finally realized their folly, how they had wasted their lives in petty rivalry. Seeing Siroth as their only hope, each prayed for the other’s survival, asking the Shadow God to allow the other to live and marry Beatrice in exchange for their own soul. Ironically, both were now competing in their magnanimity. \r\n\r\nSiroth heard them and, filled with amusement, agreed to both of them. He fused their souls together, leaving them frozen in the bitter cold and transmuted into one being for all eternity – Inithwe Bloodtwin.\r\n\r\nThe new Demonspawn railed against his fate, but could not deny his new nature as a servant of Siroth. The Shadow God kept his own end of the bargain, for Inithwe was indeed wedded to the triumphant Apraxis in a blasphemous ceremony. It was a final mockery from Siroth, salting the wounds of the new being and cementing his self-loathing and bitterness. It now mirrored the chill of the mountains where Inithwe’s existence had ended, a frigid cold that now hung eternally about him.\r\n\r\nTheir consciousness now frozen for eternity, little remains of the beings that were once Harren and Eronn bar their rage. Inithwe inflicts that rage upon Siroth’s enemies with a purple-flamed ax, its bizarre flame burning cold, and viciously draining his foes of their very life force. Woe betide any unfortunate enough to encounter the Lord of the Death-Chill on the battlefield, for he is more relentless and spiteful than his constituent souls were before his dark apotheosis.",

Once he was one of the Six Kings of the Confederation of Frostheim, and one of Graal’s only remaining memories of his old life is of the attack on the Winter Hall by the Ice Golem – an inhuman titan of living frost – who rampaged into his hall and murdered his kinsmen. He can remember collapsing to the ground, his life trickling away into the stone floor. He can remember the Sacred Order inquisitors, who had been sent to meet with him and his fellow kings, bursting in and looking on with cold eyes as his killer butchered those who might have saved him. After that, all Graal can remember is silence and darkness. Centuries wore on, and Graal lingered in a cycle of unsteady Undeath – the malefic energies of the Ice Golem occasionally reviving his frozen corpse for a matter of seconds – before slipping back into sensationless unlife.\r\n\r\nThe Winter Hall, once the seat of Frostheim's power, sat as an icy tomb for Graal and his fellow kings after the Ice Golem's attack, and was left to decay and crumble. Outside, the kingdom moved on without them. With each passing century, more of the Ice Golem's power oozed into Graal’s husk, granting the former king more control of his Undeath. After what seemed like a millennia, Graal opened his eyes, and he found his body obeyed his will. He looked around his once mighty hall, his fellow kings still frozen in death next to him. His body shaking, Graal first moved an arm. Then a leg. Then his head. Gathering enough strength, he broke the rime that caked his corpse, and unshackled himself from the throne that had held him for an age.\r\n\r\nAs Graal moved, he felt temperatures battling within his chest, a volcanic rage grappling with the glacial Undeath that had been bestowed upon him. His eyes burned with blue fire, ice formed to his legs and then, just as quickly, melted away. The roiling elemental crucible in his heart pushed Graal forward as he emerged from the Winter Hall, and he looked down on more frozen remnants of the massacre that had ended his rule in corridors and chambers. Graal left the Winter Hall behind him, marching down into the snow and ice of his homeland. He had to find out who had caused this calamity, and he had to know what had become of Frostheim. Above all else, he longed to claim revenge.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3200#static": "The Gaellen War was both the making, and the breaking, of the knight who was once known as Sir Athaulf Penrose. An able warrior and skilled tactician sworn to the Kingdom of Kaerok, Athaulf was given command of a battle-host and ordered to the Elven realm of Aravia, to assist in the defense of the High Elf port of Arrac. However, when the Gaellen Pact war fleet was seen off the coast, it quickly became clear that the king of Kaerok had made a strategic error. Rather than attempt a landing along Aravia’s shores, most of the Gaellen Pact fleet gambled against the stormy weather and carried on, bypassing the defenses of the High Elves and striking instead at Kaerok from the south.\r\n\r\nSir Athaulf did not feel he could abandon Arrac, as a number of additional Gaellen Pact troops had landed on the coast and now threatened Aravia. Forced to make the impossible choice between following his original orders and helping protect one of Kaerok’s allies, or marching back to Kaerok to defend his homeland and abandon Aravia, Athaulf decided to hold Arrac. It was the first of many times the knight would display a cold, steely determination, one that came to define his personality.\r\n\r\nAthaulf held Arrac and helped protect the Aravian coast unswervingly for a number of years, even while Kaerok burned. Eventually he was recalled by Ruthard, King of Kaerok. Though the kingdom still stood, many of its castles were shattered and its armies were decimated. Athaulf’s expeditionary force could now fulfill the role of much-needed reinforcements.\r\n\r\nOver the years that followed, Athaulf led Kaerok forces in the field against one Gaellen Pact army after another. He quickly developed a reputation not only as a skilled tactician and far-sighted strategist, but as a stern disciplinarian who commanded absolute respect, and absolute obedience, from his soldiers. His host became a lean, honed blade, every warrior a veteran dedicated to his fellow men-at-arms and, above all, to their commander. They called Athaulf the Hegemon - the leader. \r\n\r\nJaded by the relentless conflict, battle after battle, campaign after campaign, it was during these desperate times that the Cult of K’Leth first reached out to Hegemon, offering him the aid of their acolytes. They helped to preserve Kaerok’s borders, but when Siroth began the Third Great War, launching attacks all over Teleria simultaneously, Hegemon was recalled from the frontiers. He hardly recognized Kaerok. His home was now wherever his army encamped, and his soldiers were his family. He discovered that, due to the new conflict with Siroth, King Ruthard was considering ceasing his campaigns against the Gaellen Pact.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision outraged Hegemon, who had spent so many years seeking victory over the Pact. Ruthard and Hegemon found themselves set against each other. Who struck the first blow between the king of Kaerok and one of his kingdom’s foremost generals is known only to a few. What is certain is that, eventually, Hegemon wounded the king in his rage before departing their last encounter. Ruthard declared Hegemon a traitor, and even some among Hegemon’s veterans were shocked. Warriors began to desert their once-beloved general as he sought to foment rebellion. It seemed that the old wardog had fought one battle too many.\r\n\r\nIt was around this time that the Cult of K’Leth reached out to Hegemon again. Their assistance came when Hegemon most desperately needed it, as his host was being whittled down by desertion and attacks by those loyal to Ruthard. The Knights Revenant helped stem the tide, for a time anyway, but as ever, the support of the cult was fickle. It wasn’t until Hegemon’s once-proud army had been reduced down to just a dozen loyal, grizzled warriors that they agreed to provide the boon of soul transference, albeit to an unprecedented degree.\r\n\r\nHegemon demanded a new body not only for himself, but for his last remaining warriors as well. Stretching their resources, the cult eventually granted Hegemon his wish, creating not only one undying commander, but a retinue of deathless knights under his command. In exchange, Hegemon threw himself once more into the war for Kaerok, now sworn to winning it for the forces of darkness.\r\n\r\nStill however, the cult’s assistance was a double-edged sword. Other Knights Revenant, such as the creature known as Soulless, grew concerned at Hegemon’s rapid rise to prominence and withdrew their support from the war effort. Ultimately, Hegemon’s campaign collapsed, at least in the short-term. The boon of immortality, however, means that all is not lost. Hegemon continues to campaign with his dread knights, as one of the foremost generals of the Cult of K’Leth. One day, perhaps, he will conquer not only Kaerok, but the cult too, and bend both to his will in a new and terrible kingdom.",

The Lizardmen in that so-called Free City were in a miserable state after the Gaellen War, forced to work hard labor, shoved away into ghettos or sewers out of sight of the human overlords. They were little better than slaves.\r\n\r\nJizoh himself grew into one of the biggest and strongest members of his clan, but, much to their dismay, he didn’t use his natural gifts to their advantage. While they clawed to secure a better position in Arnoc’s brutal underclass, Jizoh was fascinated with the discarded trinkets and accessories he found as he went about his petty labors. He became obsessed with the Human world, constantly sneaking away from his sewer home to spy on the busy uptown marketplace. On one such trip, he saw a street vendor selling art – paintings and sculptures that the man had created.\r\n\r\nJizoh, in that moment, fell in love with art. It was as though a muse had visited him and tapped him on the shoulder. He was changed forever. Jizoh went home immediately and began crafting with whatever tools he had on hand.\r\n\r\nJizoh locked himself away for days at a time. He melted down silverware, and mixed up homemade dyes and paint. He began sneaking out of the ghettos at night to find more materials. Once he was almost caught, dropping one of his sculptures – a simple wood carving – as he escaped. A little girl found it and was taken with it. Seeing the admiration in her face was another turning point for Jizoh. He began carving small pieces and leaving them for her to find, and she giggled at each new treasure, sometimes leaving him some food in return. They even spoke, on occasion, exchanging a few words, though Jizoh was careful to keep himself hidden. He learned she was often sad, despite her fine clothes and the rich quality of the treats she left him. Her companionship became a great boon to him, and helped him find his creative muse.\r\n\r\nOne day, she found him as he was leaving her his latest creation. He quickly retreated to the shadows, terrified that his new friend would see him, and know him for a monster. She found no monster at all. The little girl cared not for Jizoh’s appearance; she only cared for how his art had enriched her life. In that moment, the world became so strange it was as if Jizoh had slipped into a dream – one where he was a proud protector of an innocent child, and an artist, free and respected.\r\n\r\nJizoh allowed himself to succumb to his fantasy a little too long. Inevitably, Jizoh was caught speaking to her. It was then that he learned who she was: the niece of a Banner Lord. Upon the discovery of a Lizardman fraternizing with a member of the superior classes, wrath came down quickly. Jizoh was tortured for his crimes by the city militia, but when he had no evil crimes to confess, they decided that he was a thief, and punished him as one: they cut off his arm at the elbow and threw him in a cell.\r\n\r\nEven in captivity, Jizoh pursued his craft. His tools were crude, and his subjects bleak, but he painted, still. His muse changed while he was imprisoned: though he could not explain, he no longer dreamed of a world where he was free, but a mysterious figure – one clad in golden armor, calling out for help…",

Many of these Ogryn are known as Occult Brawlers.\r\n\r\nAn Ogryn able to comprehend the sorceries of Siroth is easily seduced by them and they come at a cost. Spitting certain utterances or carving particular sigils into their tough flesh can enhance an Ogryn’s strength and dispel their pain, but less appreciated is the long-term degradation of body and soul that these rituals engender. In their quest for power, Occult Brawlers have often experimented with fleshwords – spells from ancient Narbukian tomes which they carve into their skin. But the price of using fleshwords is pain and disfigurement, as the body eventually twists into a monstrous form. By the time they realize that evil has taken hold of them, it is far too late for a Brawler to turn back, though many have tried.\r\n\r\nA Brawler typically starts out as an apprentice to their tribe’s shaman, though there are other ways – Ogryn living in more settled lands in Anhelt, for example, may encounter sorcerers and wizards from other species. Sorcerers sometimes employ Ogryn as cheap labor and are later surprised by the interest that the creatures take in their work. \r\n\r\nDren Hellgut, however, became an Occult Brawler by way of a chance discovery. Once a mercenary, Dren was part of a band hired by a Banner Lord to slay a Demon-worshiping sorcerer by the name of Felbane. Dren dispatched the wizard and set his tower alight, but as he left the building, the young Ogryn heard a chilling whisper. Dren followed the sound into the burning building to its source, Felbane’s blasphemous library. An open tome lay on a table, illuminated from within yet untouched by the roaring flames. Dren took it.  \r\n\r\nIn the months that followed, Dren became enthralled with the book and experimented with the incantations within it. As his power grew so did his appetite for more, and in exchange for strength and powers of self-healing, Dren scarred his flesh with the indelible marks of Siroth. Months passed and as the seasons changed, Dren realized that he had lost himself entirely to this bloody work.\r\n\r\nDren burned the arcane tome as it should have burned in the fire, and ever since the Ogryn's life has only one purpose – to cleanse his body and mind of dark magics. In this he is often steadfast, but when left with no choice, Dren uses his powers to defend himself, using fleshwords to strengthen and toughen himself. It is a power that has saved him many times, but that always sets his mission to purify himself back.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3420#static": "Tallia was the only daughter of a lord of Kaerok, and heir apparent to his fiefdom. At an early age, she began training for her future responsibilities, in swordsmanship, archery, and strategy. Tallia was destined to be a ruler, but the arrival of Fenax, a new squire to her father’s keep, changed all that. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the squire was a born troublemaker, or perhaps because of it, the two children quickly became friends. Not a day went by that Fenax didn’t get the pair into some difficulty, whether it was eavesdropping on the servants or absconding with a pair of horses for a ride in the forest. Her tutors disapproved, but were inclined to look the other way. Indeed, of all those responsible for Tallia’s tutelage, only one saw her friendship with Fenax as a problem. \r\n\r\nTallia’s father’s closest advisor was a Sacred Order priest who disapproved of her growing infatuation with the high-spirited Fenax, especially as the two grew older. The young squire would make an excellent knight but, though he was of noble birth himself, he was not noble enough a partner for a lady of Kaerok of Tallia’s station. Better, the priest thought, that they be separated before things became too serious. Such was his advice to Tallia’s father, when his lordship shared his own worries in that regard.  \r\n\r\nBy then, however, Tallia’s relationship with Fenax had already blossomed into something more than friendship. The two were in love, and Tallia desired nothing more than to spend the rest of her life with Fenax, who was on the cusp of knighthood. But her attempts to broach the subject with her father met with failure; he either ignored her entirely, or interrupted her before she could finish a single sentence. To Tallia, it seemed he had little interest in her feelings on the matter. \r\n\r\nThe priest suggested that Fenax be sent to serve with the Sacred Order as an Armiger. But some duplicity would be required to see the squire safely into the hands of those who could mold him into a proper and, more importantly, chaste, soldier of Lumaya. So it was that Fenax was sent to the Eternal Citadel the very next day, ostensibly bearing a message on behalf of his lord.\r\n\r\nTallia waited in vain for Fenax’s return. Becoming concerned for his safety when the time passed by which he should have been back, she pressed her father on the nature of the squire’s mission. When he at last admitted to his deception, Tallia was horrified. In defiance of her father and determined to find the young man, Tallia snuck out of the family’s ancestral keep, stole a horse, and rode hard for the Eternal Citadel. But a sudden storm cut her journey short and forced her to take shelter in a small, dilapidated shrine to Lumaya. \r\n\r\nThat night, Tallia’s sleep was restless. She found herself dreaming of Fenax, and the life they might have had, and might yet have. She dreamed of a woman who called herself the Arbiter, who seemed to speak for Lumaya herself. The woman told her that she and Fenax had a destiny, and that it was tied to defeating of Darkness. When Tallia awoke, she knew what she had to do. Rather than rescue Fenax from the Order, she would join it alongside him.\r\n\r\nIn the years since, Tallia has proven herself time and again to her superiors in the Sacred Order, purging Undead and Demonspawn alongside Fenax, and most recently they have journeyed to Peltas on a mission of utmost importance…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3430#static": "Fenax was born the youngest son of a destitute noble family in Kaerok. He was placed into the household of his father’s lord as a squire at an early age, to be fed as much as to learn to be a knight. But knighthood held little interest for young Fenax; instead, he found himself more inclined to seek the company of his new lord’s daughter, Tallia. The two children soon became fast friends, and rarely a day went past that Fenax didn’t duck his squire’s responsibilities in order to spend time with Tallia. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, Tallia’s father saw in Fenax the potential to be not just a knight, but a great one. Despite his disinterest in it, Fenax excelled in his training, displaying great skill with a blade and in the saddle. And while Fenax was never the wisest of squires, and his foolishness often led to trouble, he nonetheless showed a certain amount of wit, as when he talked his way out of a duel with a knight he’d inadvertently insulted or when he was captured by bandits and convinced them to spare his life by giving them the location of a 'great treasure' far away. \r\n\r\nBut as time went on and Fenax and Tallia approached adulthood, their friendship evolved into something more intimate. Too late, Tallia’s father realized that their relationship had deepened into love, and though Fenax would soon be a knight, he was not a worthy match for the daughter of a lord of Kaerok. Rumors about the two were already flying, and could endanger Tallia’s chances of finding a partner of suitable rank.\r\n\r\nTallia’s father sought the counsel of one of his advisors, a priest of the Sacred Order. The priest, seeing an opportunity to add another soul to the Order’s ranks, advised his lord to send Fenax to the Eternal Citadel, ostensibly as a messenger. Once there, Fenax would be forcibly inducted into the Order as an Armiger. While the Sacred Order preferred volunteers, it was not above taking on reluctant converts when the opportunity presented itself. The priest assured Tallia’s father that once Fenax saw that his options were limited, he would surely become accustomed to his new role. \r\n\r\nFenax was sent on his mission the next day, as far as he was concerned to deliver a message to the Order on behalf of his lord. By the time he realized his lord’s duplicity, it was already too late. His days soon blurred into a punishing regimen of training and catechism, as his new masters sought to break him of any hope of returning to either Kaerok, or Tallia. \r\n\r\nFenax had never been one to accept defeat; he charmed his new superiors with his wit and skill, gained their trust and worked out a plan of escape. But on the day he’d chosen for his attempt, a new recruit arrived at the Citadel. A familiar one, at that. \r\n\r\nIt was Tallia. When Fenax greeted her in overjoyed amazement, Tallia smiled and said that she intended to share his life, wherever it might take them. When he’d asked her how she’d known his whereabouts, she replied that Lumaya herself had shown her the way. Fenax, not so foolish as to look a gift horse in the mouth, said that if Lumaya had reunited them, then they had best repay the favor. \r\n\r\nThe two have served the Sacred Order well in the years since, and together, they have battled the forces of Darkness on dozens of battlefields. Their service has taken them throughout Anhelt and most recently into Peltas, and they have rarely left one another’s side.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3480#static": "Insouciant, fearless, and wickedly sharp-tongued, Zavia, known as the Winged Elf of Felwin, is a great enigma to the spies and statesmen of the High Elf nation of Aravia. No one knows how she acquired her famous wings, though many speculate that they are a work of magic, a clever mechanical device, or even a partial Skinwalker transformation. Her base of operations is unknown, her motives alien to the Aravian ethos. What the Aravians hold as ironclad, however, is that she is a threat to the crown and a subversive element.\r\n\r\nZavia’s crimes are repeated, unauthorized crossings of Felwin’s Wall, the dividing line between Aravia and the bulk of Anhelt, including the Dark Elf territory of Durham Forest. Her most infamous feat was to seduce Belanor, a respected High Elf administrator who had been serving on the Wall. The Aravians claim that she used supernatural means to steal his heart, or else she holds blackmail material as leverage over him. They hesitate to countenance the possibility that Belanor simply fell in love with her and joined her of his own will, even though they know in their hearts that it is a likely possibility. Admitting that an Elf can be ruled by their feelings would tarnish their international reputation. \r\n\r\nJust as dangerous, if not more so, is Zavia’s message. In statements made during encounters with Aravian authorities, she has decried the existence of Felwin's Wall, called for an end to the schism between High Elves and Dark Elves, and championed universal freedom. While she cannot tear down the Wall with her bare hands, by trespassing across it, she aims to humiliate its keepers and prove to the world that even the mightiest of barriers cannot stop a determined migrant. She demanded freedom of movement for all living things, and proclaimed all borders and all nations to be an affront to nature and an assault on personal liberty. \r\n\r\nSuch a radical, anarchic ideology was contrary to everything the Aravians stand for. Furthering their frustration is the fact that Zavia has never been spotted with smuggled goods or people, nor shown any motive besides sheer ideology. If she were bringing in rebels, stealing valuables, or committing any other typical crime, the Aravians could respond with typical means. But her vexatious idealism makes her unpredictable. Her trespasses themselves are her purpose.\r\n\r\nEyewitnesses say that Zavia does not truly fly, but uses her wings to assist in making tremendous leaps, and can glide with them to escape high places and survive a fall of any distance. With these capabilities she is easily able to loft herself over the towering Wall and then disappear over the other side, and twice as she did so she encountered Belanor. After reporting his sightings, Belanor was noted to grow distant and distracted in his work. When Zavia came to him for the third time, he disappeared along with her. Both Belanor and Zavia became outlaws and bounty hunters were dispatched to track them down.\r\n\r\nFor many months, Aravian trackers searched for the couple in vain, patrolling the Wall on both sides and investigating possible hideouts in Aravia and Durham Forest, to no avail. Despite the increased surveillance and security, Zavia has still made regular crossings of the Wall and, to the chagrin of the Aravians, Belanor has been spotted by her side. Somehow he too has acquired a pair of feathery wings, his snowy-white to Zavia’s gray. The Aravians are baffled and increasingly concerned – if the wings are not unique, but can be bestowed by some unknown process, they could prove the nucleus of a dangerous, body-modifying cult. They imagined a whole gang of winged bandits able to come and go as they pleased. Surely, they assumed, Zavia has been coming and going for some unstated purpose besides merely flaunting her capabilities. Perhaps she is starting just such a cult already, or organizing rebel cells across the border. But the most ruthless investigators of Aravia can find no conspiracies laid down by the Dark Elf intruder.\r\n\r\nRumor has it that Zavia and Belanor have been captured by the Aravian authorities, possibly more than once, only to escape later. It is said they were held in chains awaiting their execution, but when their jailors came to escort them to the chopping block, they found the shackles undone and the cell empty, undisturbed by violence, as though the prisoners had simply vanished. All that was left behind was a pair of feathers – one dark and one light, as if to symbolize the schism of the Elves. Yet, as Zavia proclaims, the schism could be mended if only the Elves could see beyond their towering wall.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3490#static": "Belanor gives the lie to some of the most cherished and embellished myths exported worldwide by the High Elves of Aravia. They would have the world believe that they have tamed their base emotions, that they are beings of pure calculating logic and reason, and that their society is orderly and obedient because High Elves are inherently superior as governors and as citizens. But such proclamations do not align with the facts of day-to-day existence. No matter what the Aravians say, High Elf rebels, dreamers, misfits, and mavericks all exist. Thanks to the charm of a Dark Elf named Zavia, Belanor joined this little-discussed minority in the course of his duty at Felwin’s Wall.\r\n\r\nThe Wall is almost entirely staffed by auxiliaries from abroad, but High Elves do live and work there in small numbers, mainly in administrative and supervisory positions. A small number of talented individuals sometimes serve as instructors for the defense forces, and drill their foreign legionnaires ruthlessly until they meet exacting Elven standards. Belanor, renowned as a master marksman and tactician, was among these martial tutors. Not long after his first season in post, his mind became occupied by stories of an intruder whose silhouette had been seen darting about the Wall. Curious, he took to nightly wanderings on the battlements.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before his vigilance bore fruit. One night, while gazing at the vast dark forest of Durham from atop the wall, Belanor’s eye was caught by something moving. He turned to see an astonishing sight: a Dark Elf woman standing on the Wall, gazing mischievously back at him and gently fluttering a pair of gray feathery wings. Stunned only briefly, he leveled his crossbow at the intruder and demanded her surrender, but she merely shot him a grin and told him she’d be seeing him again. With that, she darted away and made a seemingly-suicidal drop onto the Aravian side, only to glide to safety. Belanor could certainly have shot her down, but something stayed his hand. Instead he merely reported the security breach as protocol demanded, which earned him ridicule and disbelief. A winged Elf was, with magical augmentations or clever mechanisms not beyond the realm of possibility, but few believed the Dark Elves could have developed such a technique without Aravian reconnaissance learning of it.\r\n\r\nBut the Dark Elf and her wings were undeniably real, and she made good on her promise to see Belanor again. The next time was on her return trip from Aravia back toward Durham, and this time Belanor was prepared, and lunged at her immediately. In their tussle she told him her name was Zavia and she was surmounting Felwin's Wall to send a message: dividing their people was futile, and Elves deserved to be free. Their ongoing clash drew the attention of a nearby patrol group, and Zavia escaped. Belanor’s second failure to apprehend Zavia cast grave doubts upon him, and rumors of reprimand or dismissal swirled, but Belanor did not care. He grew obsessed with Zavia, and in time he realized he was infatuated with her. He envied her freedom, he was attracted to her impetuous and carefree ways, and as his superiors deliberated on how to handle her, he dreamed only of the chance to see her again. Who can predict or control love? Even the haughty Elves must bend to its tempestuous forces.\r\n\r\nOn their third meeting, Belanor confessed his affections. Zavia laughed, but not with malice. Then she kissed him, and held his hand in hers. She told him to hold it tightly, and led him to the ledge. At that moment a furious Ogryn sergeant arrived on the scene and bellowed that Belanor would be charged with treason. But Belanor had made his choice and, after embracing Zavia tightly, they jumped. By the time the Ogryn reached the ledge and looked down, the pair were gone, into the world of outlawry.\r\n\r\nWas Belanor bewitched? How did Zavia gain the wings that gave her the freedom to pass over Felwin's Wall? And does she have plans more complex and nefarious than simple disobedience? No one knows for sure, but in any case, Belanor has left his old life behind in search of a kind of freedom he could never have gained before.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3500#static": "The name Venus inspires lust, awe, and prayers to Lumaya wherever it is sung or whispered. The best-known account of Venus’ life tells of her being born as heir to the Barony of Innerste. She was an only child, to her parents a miracle from Lumaya. In gratitude, the baron and baroness dedicated their lives and realm to the Goddess of Light the day Venus was born, for they had believed they could no longer conceive a child. That very day the baron unceremoniously dropped his long-standing commitment that the teenage son of his closest advisor would be his heir. The boy abandoned Innerste, bitterness in his heart, mutters of vengeance on his tongue, and a bundle of rotting spellbooks under his arm.\r\n\r\nVenus was raised a devotee of Lumaya. Every day she thanked the goddess for her life, prayed in her father’s chapel, and toiled with Innerste’s monks and sisters. Faith and duty were everything to her. She also trained her body vigorously, joining the knights of her household in their daily exercises. Her experience working with the poor had shown her what could happen to those unable to defend themselves from the hated Skinwalkers, Dark Elves, and Orcs. \r\n\r\nVenus’ faith was everything to her, but it changed nothing of the fact that she was heir to her father, and that one day she would take his seat. As she grew, so did her beauty, with contradicting stories told in the present age describe hair like a river of gold, as red as a raging inferno, and abyss-black. Men from all over Innerste came to offer themselves as suitors. She spurned the advances of hundreds. One did catch Venus’ eye, a knight in elegant, crimson plate. She turned him down regardless, swearing that whoever wed her would have to prove his courage and faith beyond all measure.\r\n\r\nThe former heir of Venus’ father watched on, ugly in soul and black of heart. He spent long hours in study poring over ancient texts dedicated to dark magic and eventually submitted to Siroth in his relentless desire to learn more. With his heinous powers he had seized for himself a forbidding, hilltop stronghold. He decided to claim her for himself, in part at least to spite the baron who rejected him so coldly. Reading of an enchantment from a Skinwalker-leather tome, he whispered words in dark tongues while crushing the petals from sixty-one flowers, each of a different variety. With this he mixed the blood of a throttled lovebird, dove, and lamb. Finally, he added a dozen drops of his own life-force. \r\n\r\nThe sorcerer disguised himself as a shepherd and traveled to Innerste, where he bewitched one of Venus’ handmaidens. Upon his order the woman poured some of the enchanted potion into Venus’ morning rye-gruel. That night, Venus escaped her father’s castle, the malign magic of the potion overriding even her strong will and making her seek out her would-be entrapper. The sorcerer led her to his keep, where he locked her in a cell.\r\n\r\nVenus’ faith in Lumaya was unbreakable. As a result, the effect of the sorcerer’s potion wore off far more quickly than he intended. Venus escaped her cell. Her beauty was so great it broke the hold the sorcerer had over some of his minions’ will, and they helped her. Her warrior training enabled her to overpower more guards. But the sorcerer’s thralls and animals were too many, and she was recaptured and force-fed the potion. This cycle repeated several more times before the sorcerer realized he could only trust predatory animals guard her cell. \r\n\r\nVenus never stopped praying for Lumaya’s aid, and received her answer during another of her escape attempts. The crimson-armored knight came, wielding a huge, two-handed sword. Venus watched him cut down dozens of thralls and beasts, invoking the Goddess of Light’s name with every killing strike. She raced to his side, and they fought the sorcerer together. It was the knight who finally ended their foe’s life, driving his blade through the neck of the black-souled man. It was to be his final warrior act. He collapsed to the ground, his blood pouring over the ground around him. Venus ran to her mortally wounded rescuer, tears streaming down her cheeks. With his dying breath, Cupidus swore his undying love for her. The Arbiter then came, to preserve the crimson knight forever within a Shard. Venus knew what she had to do. There was no suitor in all the lands who could even match, let alone exceed what her rescuer had done. He had proven his faith, his strength, his bravery, his love, all traits loved by Lumaya, and thus by her. Venus pledged herself to the Arbiter’s cause, to be by her love’s side forever.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3510#static": "The Crimson Savior; the Arbiter’s Rose; the Rescuer. By these names and many more is the legendary knight of the Sacred Order best known as Cupidus widely called. Unnumbered are the tales sung of his history and exploits, and though most hold a kernel of truth at their core, most are little more than vague allegories or fanciful romances.\r\n\r\nThe most widely spun fable of Cupidus is the ode Liberation of Venus, one that has inspired many a young soul to join the Sacred Order. A thousand versions of this tale exist, but all begin with a woman of unimaginable beauty, best known to posterity as Venus. No mortal man could look upon her and not be consumed with lust and longing, and none became more besotted than a depraved sorcerer who had long sworn his allegiance to Siroth. Knowing he possessed not the charm or wit to rightly win Venus’ hand, he wove a dark enchantment to ensnare her - the details of its casting he took from a molding Skinwalker-leather tome, which had to be chained down to be read. The sorcerer’s efforts were successful. He lured Venus from her palace home and into his hilltop stronghold. The spell could not make her desire him, however, let alone induce feelings of genuine love.\r\n\r\nWord rapidly spread that Venus had gone missing. Thousands of knights pledged their swords and steeds to finding her - many in the hopes she would marry them, others with no such expectation but no less determined to see her safe. But the sorcerer had concealed his route well, with numerous spells that threw packs of hounds into disarray, befuddled the minds of experienced trackers, and terrified war-scarred destriers. He had not counted on Venus’ faith, however. Few knights’ shared the strength of her conviction, and only one possessed the purity of heart to see and follow the invisible trail Venus’ unbreakable belief left in her wake. Cupidus. A warrior of peerless renown, prodigious bladesmanship, and pious humility. He found the sorcerer’s stronghold.\r\n\r\nIce-cold rain fell in sheets as Cupidus picked his way through clumps of razor-sharp rocks and tangles of tough, thorny vines to reach the stone keep in which he knew Venus was kept prisoner. Overhead soared dozens of three-eyed blackbills - the sorcerer’s spies. They saw Cupidus’ crimson plate armor gleam whenever a terrible lightning bolt shot down from the heavens and reported to the sorcerer, who realized he was discovered. He moved to kill the interloper knight. Hundreds were the beasts and servants the sorcerer had bound to his will, and he demanded the knight’s head. And so before Cupidus even reached the castle’s walls he was assailed by the sorcerer’s followers. With his sword, known to legend now as the Heart of Lumaya, Heartbreaker, and the Crux of Valor, he slew them all. Caked in gore and ichor, he reached the keep’s gate after filling the ditch before it with the corpses of those he had slain. He smashed the sealed entrance open with the head of a decapitated Skinwalker.\r\n\r\nWithin the stronghold were yet more of the sorcerer’s followers. Wolverines, poison-spitting death-adders and magically engorged rats. As the rain lashed down, blood flowed even faster. Some of it was the knight’s.\r\n\r\nFinally, Cupidus came to the sorcerer himself, though in this fight he would not stand alone. Venus, who had escaped her shackles and cell, was with him. \r\n\r\nDark magic swirled around the sorcerer, his black cloak billowing in the evil energy. He unleashed every ounce of his Siroth-given magic at Cupidus as more of his servants plunged into the fray. In the titanic clash that followed, the knight’s armor was rent by terrible claws. He was engulfed in violet flames and jagged blades pierced his flesh. But eventually Cupidus drove the Heart of Lumaya into the sorcerer’s chest. In the seconds that followed, the knight’s strength finally abandoned him, and he collapsed. Venus rushed to his side. As she knelt over the broken, dying form of Cupidus, tears streaming down her cheeks, the Rescuer swore his love for her would last forever, even if he could not. Venus promised the same.\r\n\r\nThe Arbiter saw and heard everything, so the bards sing. She could not bear to see such love be lost forever. After affixing the wings of a slain three-eyed blackbill to Cupidus’ helm as a symbol of his victory, she used her power to save the Crimson Savior and preserve him in a Shard. He has since earned his title on innumerable battlefields, his rose-colored armor a symbol of hope to the desperate and the lost.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3530#static": "Alongside the Dungeon of Torments, the Hellfire Wastes is one of the most infamous regions of Anathraad, the dreaded realm ruled over by the Shadow God, Siroth. A place of sulfur, brimstone, and undying fire, it is among the most prominent parts of Anathraad in many mortal stories, a seat of eternal punishment. Less well known is the fact that for many centuries its ruler was also its prisoner.\r\n\r\nIxlimor was one of Siroth’s Firstborn Demonspawn. Strong, boastful, and redolent with pride, he led and fought in the vanguard of the armies of darkness and won many great victories. He soon began to grow disillusioned, however, when a more senior Demonspawn general, Mortu-Macaab, received much of the plaudits and reaped the rewards. Ixlimor became jealous, and started clashing openly with Mortu-Macaab, demanding he be shown what he thought of as respect befitting his success. When Mortu-Macaab passed off his anger as childish and petty, he only grew more enraged.\r\n\r\nIxlimor decided to challenge Mortu-Macaab for his position of generalship, preparing in secret for the duel he knew would ensue once he declared it. Siroth learned of all things that passed within his realm, and soon came to know of Ixlimor’s intentions, but did nothing to intervene. The Shadow God prized strength in all matters, and Ixlimor’s upstart attitude was just the thing to keep Mortu-Macaab focused and aware that his station was not inviolable.\r\n\r\nThe challenge was issued, and the two great Demons met in combat before the gaze of Siroth and much of the twisted nobility of Anathraad, out on the Sundered Plains. Long and vicious was the battle, both combatants venting their frustrations and their hatred on one another. Mortu-Macaab’s station was well won, however, and try as he might, Ixlimor could not get the better of him. He was defeated, cast down and broken, brutalized by the pounding of Mortu-Macaab’s fists and the gouging of his great horns.\r\n\r\nThe pain of Ixlimor’s injuries was nothing compared to the pain of knowing that he had lost. Anathraad’s hierarchy was built on aggression and strength, and failure was to be abhorred. Ixlimor fell immediately from Siroth’s favor and, on the Shadow God’s orders, was cast out. He was banished to the Hellfire Wastes, a place of eternal, ethereal flames and barren, razor-sharp rock, inhabited only by the most desperate, lesser Demonspawn.\r\n\r\nLong did Ixlimor wander amid the flames, their rage and heat slowly seeping into his very soul. The fires healed his wounds and blackened his flesh. Some say they helped ensure that his fury never faded. As his strength returned, he embarked on a fresh campaign. If he could not lead Siroth’s grand armies, he would at least become the ruler of the benighted place he had been banished to. After mastering the flames and bending them to his will, he set out to secure the fealty of the Demonic imps, sprites, and outcasts consigned to the Hellfire Wastes. Their first allegiance would always be to Siroth, but after that it would be Ixlimor – now styling himself as Tyrant – whom they would obey.\r\n\r\nIxlimor's efforts proved successful, and the denizens of the Wastes now bow before him. Siroth has long been aware of Ixlimor’s activities, and it may be that they please him. While banishment seemed a fittingly harsh punishment at the time, Siroth always looks to push the boundaries of his underlings, and some members of his Demonic court whisper that the Shadow God hopes being cast out will allow Ixlimor to recover his strength and purpose, and become greater than he was before. Certainly, if that is Siroth’s intention, he seems to have succeeded. An army of Demonspawn outcasts and lesser creatures of Anathraad now follows Ixlimor’s every command, and it appears that the Tyrant is just biding his time until he marches from the Wastes and demands his banishment be lifted. There is little doubt he will then once more challenge Mortu-Macaab for greatness. Some believe that his fiery need for vengeance goes even further, and that one day there will be a reckoning between the Tyrant of the Hellfire Wastes and Siroth himself.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3560#static": "Of all the figures throughout the history of Teleria, none loom larger than the Arbiter. The wilder, older histories say that she was the most beloved of Lumaya, that she was the template on which the Elves were created, and that she is and was a warrior of incomparable power and skill. Legends paint her as the immortal protector of all of Teleria, fighting an endless war against Siroth down the centuries – a sentinel with an eternal vigil, and with endless vigilance to match.\r\n\r\nNone of that is wrong. But the full truth is in short supply, and what little is known has been distorted by time, error, and cruel intention. And so, when one speaks of the Arbiter, one might speak of three different people: the Arbiter of the ancient tales, the Arbiter that the Sacred Order tries to forget, and the Arbiter of the world today.\r\n\r\nThe Arbiter of long ago, spoken of in hidden texts and painted on crumbling ruins, was a warrior – that much can be held in certainty. She fought to protect Teleria, and even the most cautious scholars agree that the Arbiter was the ultimate leader of the Telerians during the First and Second Great Wars – wars in which the existence of Teleria itself was threatened by Siroth’s mighty hordes of Undead and Demonspawn. This Arbiter was a hero, and she called herself the ‘Herald of Lumaya’. Little else is known.\r\n\r\nAmong the knights of the Sacred Order, the Arbiter is not spoken of at all. She is not unknown to them, precisely – she is a vacuum, a void, an empty hole in their faith and doctrines. She has been carefully cut out of the Order, her statues toppled and her commands erased. The Arbiter of the Sacred Order is a mark of shame, or perhaps a mark of betrayal. Whose betrayal? Whose shame? That knowledge has been lost – or, it has been destroyed outright.\r\n\r\nToday, precious few alive have met the Arbiter, or even recognize her. If the tales of her power and leadership were ever true, she has now long since faded – gone is the Herald of Lumaya, commander of the armies of Teleria, destroyer of Siroth and smiter of the Demonspawn legions. All that is left is visions of an Elf-like woman, wandering the roads of the kingdoms that only exist because of what she has done.\r\n\r\nIf one were to ask her who she is, she will say she is one of the Firstborn, that she was witness to the horror of the Great Divorce, and that she is the last protector of Lumaya’s True Will. She will talk of how much the world seems to be slipping between her fingers. Where once entire nations raised their armies at her command, she now compels only beggars and saints – the truly desperate, or the mad. Where once her gratitude was coveted by kings and emperors alike, now she is all but forgotten. Where once she was a symbol of order and stability, she is little more than myth, and useless wars cripple the only powers capable of defying the shadow that she sees seeping into the world with every passing day.\r\n\r\nBut the Arbiter fights on, regardless of all this, for at least part of the myths is true indeed: she has an eternal vigil, matched with endless vigilance. And while much of her power may be spent, and her presence in the physical world is something she can never maintain for long, she still has her Shards. She still has her Champions. Most of Teleria may have given up on the Arbiter, but she will never give up on Teleria.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3570#static": "Some say that luck carries its own curse, and rarely has that idea been more clearly demonstrated than in the being of Shamrock. The early years of his life felt lucky enough to him. He grew up happily in a simple farming hamlet found on the edge of Durham Forest, where he was of great assistance in plowing or logging, and Shamrock was much loved among his people. Through his hard work and happy demeanor, Shamrock was a central figure during the yearly harvest festival, when he was draped in all manner of greenery, particularly the shamrock sprigs he adored.\r\n\r\nShamrock’s idyllic existence came to an end when Dark Elf raiders struck from the depths of Durham. With Shamrock’s assistance, the villagers were able to drive the attackers away, but not before many homes had been burnt and their occupants dragged into the darkness of the forest. The attack changed Shamrock, and brought on a moroseness which not even the harvest festival could lift. He no longer found joy in his simple duties, and when a traveling wizard passed through the hamlet, he agreed to go with him and his party on his quest.\r\n\r\nThe wizard’s name was Artemos, and he was impressed enough by the strength and size of the Ogryn – as well his expendability – to accept him into his company. Artemos was seeking a fabled cache of gold, said to have been hidden on the edge of Durham Forest by an alchemist. Despairing of ever finding the hidden treasure, and unconcerned that a spell might backfire on an Ogryn, Artemos cast an experimental incantation on Shamrock while he slept, a fortune-charm that he believed would enable him to locate gold wherever it was concealed.\r\n\r\nArtemos was far from accomplished in the magic arts, and while the spell initially appeared to have gone off without a hitch, in reality it had only been half successful. For while Shamrock did indeed locate the gold, what Artemos had really done was bequeath him with a spell that was half-charm, half-hex. Shamrock could find gold and was blessed with bouts of outrageous luck, but just as surely, a period of terrible misfortune would then befall both him and all around him.\r\n\r\nThis quickly became apparent with a sequence of events that began with their find. The moment they unearthed the gold, Dark Elves struck at the party from the forest, killing most of them and stealing half the hoard. Later, Artemos was able to make back most of the coinage by winning a number of games of chance with other adventurers in Delanos, only to be arrested on charges of fraud by the city guard. One night the jailer became intoxicated, and his keys slipped between the bars into the cell where Shamrock and Artemos were being held. They were able to escape, but in order to flee the city they were forced to take to the sewers where they almost drowned in muck. And so things continued, until Artemos realized that his magics were to blame for their wildly fluctuating circumstances.\r\n\r\nArtemos made an effort to reverse the effects of his spell, but to no avail – Shamrock immediately fell into a vat of ale, where he became delightfully intoxicated at the cost of almost drowning for the second time in as many days. Not knowing what else to do, Artemos simply abandoned the Ogryn.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before stories about Shamrock spread. Another party of gold-seeking adventurers hired him in exchange for an unlimited supply of drink and their companionship, for though Shamrock loved the strongest brews he could get his hands on, the drink did nothing to ease his longing for his old village friends. The group soon realized that the positive and negative elements of Shamrock’s particular affliction had not been exaggerated after all, as they found themselves on their own path of extremes – traveling through alternating sunshine and thunderstorms or discovering easy shortcuts before enduring river crossings where the bridges kept collapsing. They were struck down by dysentery, then found their spirits renewed during an inexplicably free stay at one of the finest inns in southern Anhelt. At the end of it all, they discovered that the gold Shamrock had tracked down was in fact only a single – albeit very valuable – coin. Arguments over how it was to be divided quickly caused the party to split, with Shamrock wandering off in search of fresh ale.\r\n\r\nDespite the unlucky aspect of Shamrock's fate, there are always those in Teleria who have been struck by gold-fever and are desperate and greedy enough to hire him. For his own part, as long as he’s got a brew in one fist, Shamrock is happy enough, for he knows his luck will always even out in the end.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3590#static": "The curse of the Skinwalkers is spread when Siroth’s Undeath touches the spirit of a dead animal and causes it to lash out at whatever or whoever it can. This means that, regardless of the context, those who frequently kill animals or deal with carcasses are most at risk of randomly becoming a new Skinwalker. Despite the catechisms of the Sacred Order, and often convincing circumstantial evidence, affliction has no moral component. The transformation and its transmission can be suffered by any in the mortal world – it is not a particular judgment or condemnation of an individual. The fierce albino killer known as Sniktraak is a tragic example.\r\n\r\nSniktraak once lived in a small village in the Duchy of Sench-Vallerwoul in Kaerok and made his way as spinerat-catcher, beloved by all for undertaking the miserable job of dealing with noxious vermin with a smile on his face. However, behind the jolly workman’s façade was a wounded, bitter, alienated soul. He unleashed his secret rage and cruelty upon the rats that he hunted, taking twisted joy in the animals’ suffering and always leaving some behind to breed so that he could have his fun again soon, and so he could keep his job. None of those who knew him would believe that the polite and obedient lad was so internally troubled, and even those who witnessed hints of his deepening sickness rationalized away their concerns. Why have sympathy for the pests anyway? Why not let him vent his frustrations? Why speak up and suggest he be relieved of rat-catching duty, only to have the eyes of the town fall upon oneself as the natural replacement? Changing the way of things is difficult for some toilsome rural communities, and silence often hangs heavy over ugly open secrets. Had knowledge of, and tolerance for, the Skinwalker curse been more abundant in this village, perhaps the danger of wantonly slaying so many creatures would have been recognized. But it was not.\r\n\r\nThe last rat Sniktraak ever slaughtered perished in body, but its spirit clawed its way under his skin and up his arm, burrowing, and bored into his brain. The revenant animal spirit and the soul of the troubled young man clashed, merged, separated, and merged again, over and over in a process of violent reconfiguration. And while the human soul, as it usually does, won its battle against the invader, the process caused irreversible spiritual change. And with it came a wrenching transformation of his physical body, and a period of primordial hunger and delirium. He found himself far from his village with his new rodent-like hands and dagger-like fangs coated with dried blood, and only the very creatures he despised now willing to be his new companions. When he returned to what was once home, he found doors smashed down or chewed through, the granaries emptied, and the picked-clean skeletons of men and beasts alike. Was it his own doing, he despaired, or that of the corrupted rat spirit? Anyone would have lost their mind, and so, Sniktraak did.\r\n\r\nHis old identity forgotten and a guttural new name given to him by his chittering companions – or perhaps by his own delusions, for little separates the two – Sniktraak became an instrument of vengeance for all verminkind, and soon was striking terror into the villagers of the nearby countryside. Swordsmen of the Banner Lords and Militants of the Sacred Order sent to investigate were torn to shreds. When elite knights were dispatched, they were hollowed out within their shiny armor by tiny fangs or else bashed to a pulp by Sniktraak with his mighty morning stars, which he took from some of his first victims and has since grown excessively fond of. Hammering had always been one of his favorite ways of dispatching annoying creatures…\r\n\r\nTales of a ‘Rat-man’ bearing such names as ‘The Gnawing Flood’ and ‘The Eating of Breughshire’ have grown and spread, the stories exaggerating the truth but conveying the essential horror of Sniktraak’s modus operandi. Successive attempts to stop him, successful or not, necessarily involved slaying hundreds of members of his now-infamous swarm. As more and more animals died around him, more and more tainted rat souls clung to his own, intensifying the power of the Skinwalker curse. It would take a tremendous work of purifying magic to give Sniktraak another chance to forge a new, stable identity in his Skinwalker body, though the bonding of the animal soul to his own is irreversible. And though the excess spirits could hypothetically be purged – upon contact with the uninfected – his madness is another matter entirely.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3600#static": "Even from a young age, Teodor was most charitably described by others as ‘different.’ With an intellect matched only by his obsessive behavior, the child attended one of the most prestigious universities in Anhelt but, in the first of a number of sad and ironic twists, was expelled due to his fixated behavior. Teodor was initially enrolled to study medicine, but refused to only attend the lectures he was assigned. He sat in on classes on alchemy, astronomy, the natural world, and the arcane arts. He wrote essays on subjects he was not enrolled on, undertook projects for the academic staff that they had not requested, and continually pestered everyone from his tutors to the institution’s librarians about an endless array of topics and theories. It was not long before he was also refusing to sit particular tests or ignoring assignments because he believed they were beneath him or unnecessary for one of his obvious abilities.\r\n\r\nIt became too much for the university to control and so, with regret, the ruling council of scholars had Teodor banished. Such an act, in his formative years, had a devastating effect on Teodor’s psyche, and lay at the root of the horror that was to come.\r\n\r\nEmbittered and enraged, Teodor foreswore the university and academic institutions in general. He embarked on a quest to become the perfect scholar, one that all other so-called men and women of learning would look to with envy and awe. While his interests spanned an incredibly broad range of subjects, it was in biological matters that he eventually found his greatest passion. He trained as a physician, but considered the desire to only heal the body to be short-sighted. He wished also to delve into the mechanics of the soul itself, to cut to the core of the nature of existence. Considering nothing to be off-limits for his superior intellect, he soon strayed into the study of necromancy. It was around this time that he first came across the concept of soul gems and, via it, the Cult of K’Leth.\r\n\r\nTeodor sought out a Soul Shepherd of the Knights Revenant named Mastrix, and asked him to take him on as his apprentice. Mastrix initially refused, until Teodor conducted a perfect soul transmission on two cultists, right there in front of him. Shocked at Teodor’s potent mixture of intellect and natural ability, Mastrix reconsidered. It wasn’t long before Teodor was inducted as a Soul Shepherd, securing, at the same time, his own immortality.\r\n\r\nOne of Teodor’s first acts as a Knight Revenant was to return to the university that had expelled him. On a dark and terrible night, Teodor stalked the corridors of the revered institution accompanied by a pack of whooping K’Leth cultists who, on his orders, kidnapped each and every single academic they could lay their hands on, while leaving the shocked students untouched. The terrified scholars were taken and confined to what would become Teodor’s secret laboratory, which he had established since fleeing the academy on the outskirts of Narbuk. There they were kept like cattle as the deranged Knight Revenant’s plans for them slowly became apparent.\r\n\r\nWhile most Knights Revenant choose to have their souls transferred to bodies that are young, strong and healthy, Teodor derives twisted delight from claiming the bodies of those academics who once rejected him. Nor does he show restraint when it comes to using said bodies as part of his own, eternally-ongoing research. Constantly seeking to break the bounds of the scientific and the arcane, he happily experiments on his own stolen flesh and blood, knowing that no matter what happens to his physical form, his soul is safe with another unwilling host waiting. Quite what he intends to do once the last of the despairing scholars is used up, remains unclear.\r\n\r\nTeodor is now known as the Savant among his fellow Knights Revenant, and is viewed by most as a dangerous madman. His brilliance is undeniable however, and he continues to perform the role of Soul Shepherd to the cult. Down the years he has found the battlefield to be a fascinating trial ground for his experiments, especially regarding physiology, the impact of deadly arcane magics, the sundering of bodies from the souls that inhabit them, and the development of poisons and toxins. The lattermost he views as something akin to a hobby, and his laboratory is full of dire brews and bubbling, stinking cauldrons. For all of these reasons Teodor will happily pack his vials, lift his staff, and accompany his fellow adherents of K’Leth into the maelstrom of combat, where he puts the latest body he has stolen from those who once rejected him to good use, annihilating the foes of the cult and indulging his own warped curiosity at the same time.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3610#static": "There is a very archaic title among the High Elves of Aravia, that of Basileus. This honorific dates back centuries, and it may have first been bestowed by the Lightbringers themselves. The lore surrounding it is sweeping and grandiose, of an epic scope befitting its origin in the legendary youth of the world. The Basileus is an avatar of the whole kingdom, Aravia made flesh, the health and wealth of the nation personified in the body and the deeds of a single individual. Their form was strong, beautiful, and perfect, free of any blemish. Their weapons were like an extension of their body, and thus an extension of Aravia itself. Their life was wholly in service of the state, ready to be laid down for the good of the realm at any time. No Basileus has lived up to this ideal better than Roanas.\r\n\r\nIt was the Gray Age, the ancient period of maturation and rebirth that followed the expulsion of the gods and the Firstborn from Teleria. Though held at bay by great magics, Siroth still plotted to infiltrate and invade the world he had been denied, and finally did so many years after his banishment. The Arbiter foresaw this invasion, and she put forth a great call to the mortal races. Roanas, the soul of Aravia, was swift to answer this call, and marshaled a truly glorious host of gold and white, countless thousands of archers in gleaming, perfect ranks, foot soldiers with shining halberds arrayed, and cavalry upon exquisite Elven-reared steeds. The Arbiter’s forces mustered in a great valley near her immense Tower in the Cloudspire Mountains. Amid the haggard, forced-marched Humans of Yakai and proud Dragonkin, amid the Orcs and Ogryn in their mismatched and hastily-gathered gear, the majestic Elves in white and gold stood at the forefront, or so the Elven tales go. So striking was Roanas and his host that it, and he, became known as the Great White Eagle – a bird of prey whose wings of cavalry and claws and beak of steadfast warriors would fight fiercely and proudly.\r\n\r\nThe Demonspawn arose from the depths and filled up the valley like a deluge. They were reckless and impatient for bloodshed, heedless of what they might encounter. As this nightmare swarm boiled up at them, the Great White Eagle held firm at the vanguard, and all the kindred folk of Teleria stood with him. He nocked his golden greatbow and fired a gleaming shot into the Demonspawn horde, and at this signal his archers followed suit. As the horde engulfed the host of Light, Roanas’ halberdiers and cavalry defended their archers, as the Humans and others fought on the flanks in looser skirmishes. \r\n\r\nFor hour after hour, the Elves cut down enraged Demonspawn, who threw wave after endless wave of bodies into their nonstop, grinding assault. All who fought in the Arbiter’s coalition that day won glory for themselves, but none greater than Roanas. Like a man possessed he fought as if without pain or exhaustion, firing arrow after arrow and shouting oaths invoking the Arbiter’s judgment with each shot. Many were those who, wounded or wavering in faith, saw and heard the Basileus and were moved to fight once more. He himself was struck a dozen times or more, and even with blood leaking from his armor he fought on and on. When their arrows were depleted, he and the archers descended into melee with knives, boots, and their very fists.\r\n\r\nAs the Demonspawn finally began to break, and withdraw sullenly, Roanas was still dealing death with his blade and warding off blows with his great golden bow. When the last Demonspawn had fled, he leaned upon it so that he might die without falling to the ground. The survivors of his Great White Eagle, and all those who defended the Arbiter and her dream of a peaceful and blessed Teleria, came forth. They picked their way across the devastated battlefield littered with the fallen, to be with him as he breathed his last, to mourn for the great hero of the battle. But before death could take him, the Arbiter herself descended among them and produced a Shard of purest golden hue, a fittingly glorious home for Roanas’ everlasting essence. The mortal form of Basileus Roanas died cradled in the Arbiter’s embrace, but his soul lived on within her Shard, preserved for all eternity to serve her in battles to come. \r\n\r\nThis is the great Aravian national mythos, their legendary history of a long-distant past, embellished and mythologized over generations. It may be taken with a grain of salt. But High Elves still pray and wish for the return of Basileus Roanas to this day.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3660#static": "Rakka’s upbringing was not the kind she or her father would have wished for. Her father, the warlord Hakka Grimbone, failed to produce any other offspring and hoped for a strong and militarily talented child to continue the family’s legacy of leadership, for his forebears had been powerful generals of the Gaellen Pact with many kills and battles to their name. But as Rakka grew up she showed a proclivity for magics and alchemical sorcery, finding much effect in the transformation of harmless substances into deadly serums or toxic elixirs. To Hakka’s mind such a fascination was unbecoming of the descendant of a great commander, and because of this, father and daughter rarely saw eye to eye.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that things would change when Rakka came of age, Hakka bestowed the rank of banner-bearer upon her. It was her task to bear the standard of the warband Hakka commanded – the Fire Axes – into battle, as well as to act as its herald and emissary.\r\n\r\nTo Hakka’s surprise, Rakka embraced her new duties when her father’s warband left the Redspike Mountains to campaign against several Free Cities that had recently driven Orc clans left behind after the Gaellen War from their domains. What her father didn’t know was that Rakka’s enthusiasm had little to do with her wish to enhance the Grimbone name and reputation, and everything to do with field testing her experiments. Being in the thick of the action was the best way to view the effects of her concoctions.\r\n\r\nRakka's efforts soon met with disaster. She had created a sword whose toxic core poisoned anyone it cut, and through some mishap, she infected herself and lost her sight. Horrified, Hakka forbade her from conducting any further experiments and demanded she give up her role as banner-bearer. Rakka refused. If she had inherited one of her father’s traits, it was his bone-headed determination.\r\n\r\nIn the next months, Hakka’s host lay siege to the powerful citadel at Fornguard, and was faring poorly. Rakka wandered with the standard into the surrounding wilderness, telling her father that he was not to come looking for her. What transpired there is unknown, but many believe Rakka was communing with the spirits of the wild, seeking their guidance and aid in renewing herself and rediscovering her purpose. When she returned, banner still clutched in her fist, she was accompanied by a great flock of ravens and festooned with their jet-black feathers. She claimed she saw through their eyes – her unblinking stares and twitching motion seemed to confirm what she said as true.\r\n\r\nHakka worried that his only child had been driven to madness by her injury and toxins, and at first her demands only seemed to confirm his fears. She convinced him to feed some of the warband’s cattle an unwholesome concoction she had devised and then, when the beasts sickened and died, had their carcasses launched by catapult over the high walls of Fornguard. The effect on the garrison was almost immediate. There was a virulent outbreak of disease which quickly whittled down the once-impervious defenders. While the garrison was not wiped out, it was badly crippled, and the outcome of the siege for the defenders was thrown into further doubt when follow-up Orc bombardments with more conventional munitions breached the walls.\r\n\r\nScorning fears that she was too vulnerable or no true warrior to fight, Rakka demanded the honor of leading the assault. Hakka, fearful but proud, granted it. By the time night fell, Rakka had planted her banner at the top walls next to the breach. Next morning, it flew from atop Fornguard’s keep.\r\n\r\nRakka had secured her place within the annals of Orc war stories. Though her father eventually died and the army he had built broke apart, she never gave up her banner – nor her talent for toxincraft. She became known as Rakka Viletide, and her concoctions have ever since been sought out by warlords and clan chieftains. To this day Rakka’s presence is thought worth more than a hundred mighty warriors, for while she can weaken or slay foes with wicked poisons, she can also brew tinctures that bring vigor to her allies. Though she travels across Teleria selling her skills to the highest bidder, some say that she is no mere mercenary and that one day her old, toxin-laced banner will fly in triumph at the head of a powerful warband of her own.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3670#static": "When the City of Dreams was burned by the Telerian League at the end of the Gaellen War, there were few survivors. Some fled the siege early, escaping with little more than their skins. Others came to defend their home to the last, only to arrive too late. Some survived through sheer luck. Many perished inside the walls, unable to save their ruined dreams. The last surviving member of the Gaellen Warclave, Rhazin Scarhide, supposedly died fighting the supreme commander of the Telerian League, Scyl of the Drakes, but their bodies were never found. Some even today speculate they both escaped the bloodshed, somehow.\r\n\r\nThere was one survivor, though, who watched the city fight, and die, all from the great hill overlooking it. They were a great lump of a Lizardman, sporting a strange shell that almost seemed to be part of him. He barely moved, and barely spoke. When the last ember of the burning city had gone out, and the last invader had withdrawn to their ship, Krisk the Ageless let out a long, bitter sigh at last.\r\n\r\nHad another been standing next to him when he left his post, Krisk might have explained himself. He might have said that he was watching, hoping for a new beginning for his people. He might have shared his disappointment that he had seen it all before – the rise to power, the ambition for the future, and the crippling fall from grace. He was there when the Lizardmen called themselves Dragonkin, who had fully believed in their own strength, and their responsibility to protect the world from chaos. He had seen that strength do great things. Too often, he had seen that same strength destroy them.\r\n\r\nKrisk would also have shared his hopes for the City of Dreams. Rhazin Scarhide might have believed that the dream of that city was his own, but it was a dream of all Lizardmen and all Gaellens, from the lowest Ogryn  to the proudest Orc. The dream that they were equals. The dream that they were strong, and that they no longer had to live in fear. But Krisk would also claim that it was a dream corrupted by a lust for revenge, for power, and to conquer the world for their own. It was the kind of dream that forges an empire, but the kind of dream that kills it, too. Krisk would say that he would know, because he had seen it all before. He was the last Dragonkin who remembered who they had been, and believed in who they could become.\r\n\r\nBut Krisk the Ageless said none of that, because he was alone. He would have another age to wait, perhaps, before he could stand upon such a hill again, and dare to dream.",

For fifteen years, there was little honor to be found in arms. The destruction wrought to all parties was cataclysmic, with every nation crawling out battered and broken.\r\n\r\nThis era of strife was a crucible for Captain Grohak, who fought for the Gaellen Pact. In command of one of hundreds of ships that sailed across the Valdemar Strait from Peltas to Anhelt, Grohak's confidence knew no bounds. He believed his Dwarven-built ship to be nigh-indestructible, and the huge Gaellen fleet to be all but unstoppable. As the Gaellens advanced the Aravian fleet arrayed to stop them, and he plowed his vessel right into the thick of the Elven ships, directly disobeying the orders of his superiors who demanded the armada to keep formation. Each broadside from Grohak's Skyiron arcanic bolt throwers ripped through enemy vessels left and right. His warship cut a swathe through Aravian ships, with each sinking only fueling Grohak's bloodlust. Other captains plunged their crews into the fray upon seeing Grohak’s bloody success. It was then that the tide began to turn.\r\n\r\nGrohak was drunk with desire for battle, and the nightmarish chaos of the battle was all but impossible to follow for his hard-pressed crew. None paid enough attention to the currents, waves, and landscape, and Grohak's ship fetched up on a sandbank on the northern mouth of Tilshire Bay. It was not alone. Dozens of Gaellen craft had done the same. Excitement turned to panic as Gaellen crews desperately tried to dislodge their vessels from the muck, while Aravian frigates and longships moved in for the kill. Magically hurled rocks, ballistae bolts, volleys of arrows, and torrents of emerald chem-fire came in from all sides. Gaellens burned, screaming in agony, or were riddled with Elven shot. Ships were punched through with holes. Boarding parties soon followed. Vengeful Elven warriors fell upon Grohak's remaining crew as they scrambled to battle stations. It was a slaughter. Blood stained the deck of Grohak’s ship, as well as his fearsome panoply, crimson. In one last desperate attempt to throw off the assault, one of Grohak's warlocks fired a spell into the ship's magazine, disrupting the fragile spellwork holding the ammunition there together. The explosion ripped the ship to pieces, its thunderous boom echoing all the way to the southern mouth of the Valdemar Strait.\r\n\r\nLater, the water foamed with blood, as chunks of ship, soldier, and metal washed out to sea. Grohak drifted in a lifeless daze as his body was carried away by the tide upon a slat of wood. He eventually washed up near one of the Gaellen landing sites – a small beach near Tilshire. There, he witnessed the utter failure of the landing, and the terror he felt in those final moments aboard his vessel fell upon him once again. He witnessed waves of Orcs mown down by rapidly repeating Elven bolt throwers. Skinwalkers, eager to take their revenge for the crimes of the Red Crusade walked headlong into fields of hidden caltrops, clutching paws and hooves pierced by the wicked steel. So crippled, they were easy targets for blocks of Sacred Order Yeomen. He smiled when he saw Ogryn literally ripping apart Kaerok Pikemen and Swordsmen, but it fell from his face when wedges of knights bearing family colors and coats of arms charged in. Lance after lance found its mark in Ogryn backs and necks, bringing down creature after creature. Clusters of Lizardmen faired little better. For each disciplined Elven spearman they mauled in their attempt to gain the high ground, two more were impaled upon Aravian steel.\r\n\r\nGrohak turned away from the sight, his armor dented and scarred, still stained by the blood of comrades and enemies. He found his way inland, but did not take up the fight. He swore he would never fight again. For as long as he drew breath, he would slay no mortal, not unless it was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nBut there was one who listened to that oath, and found Grohak a convenient loophole. When the Arbiter came to him, seeking aid for the Third Great War she knew was coming, Grohak the Bloodied accepted. Perhaps, he hoped, he could find some kind of redemption. Demonspawn and the Undead were far from mortal.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3770#static": "For those Dark Elves unlucky enough to be born outside of the noble enclaves, life is often nasty, brutish, and short for those without the protection of a noble patron or powerful guild. The desire to survive and accumulate power drives even the lowliest of servants, and acts of violence, cruelty, and betrayal are the quickest way to do so. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say that there is no such thing as law and order among the Dark Elves, however. Rather, the mailed fist of the law is applied more forcefully on the poor, and then often only at the behest of the elite. Needless to say, every settlement has its own way of enforcing its rules, but most employ the services of various mercenaries and cutthroats as ad hoc police forces. \r\n\r\nIt is one such force that Captain Temila commands. She and her crew are the law in the settlement of Blackthorn, in the southern shadow-groves of Durham Forest. As one of the larger settlements in one of the safer parts of the forest, Blackthorn has a population double that of its nearest neighbor, which means that it has double the unrest.\r\n\r\nTemila began her career as a simple soldier in Blackthorn’s expeditionary forces. She and her fellows were tasked with protecting the logging parties sent to clear pathways through the forest and collect wood for construction. These expeditions were and are highly dangerous, but lucrative, as the giant insects that stalk the deep woods are relentless in their hostility to the Elven invaders. More than once, Temila fought these nightmarish monsters, but to her credit, not a single wood harvest was lost… though many of the loggers were not so lucky. It was this rate of success that saw her promoted through the ranks, until she was given command of an outpost at the far edge of Blackthorn’s territory.\r\n\r\nTemila’s new responsibilities included the inspection of goods and travelers using the few relatively safe paths through the forest. It was in this capacity that she first made the acquaintance of the master of Blackthorn’s chitin-collector’s guild. The chitin-collectors journeyed deep into the forest in search of the discarded husks of the great insects that dwelt there. These valuable exoskeletons have a variety of uses, including as components for armor. \r\n\r\nWhen a caravan of chitin-collectors came under attack by one of the larger forest-monsters, a hulking beetle-like beast, Temila and her warriors responded swiftly. While many of the caravanners perished, Temila ensured that the cargo of husks was preserved. Her quick-thinking earned her the favor of the guildmaster, who saw in her the perfect person to oversee law and order in Blackthorn. His recommendation to the nobles who funded his expeditions saw her promoted once more, to ensure the security of the entire settlement. \r\n\r\nTemila is ruthless when it comes to the preservation of Blackthorn and its elites, favoring a heavy hand when it comes to matters of public safety and the preservation of her masters’ property, as well as her own reputation. For Temila, that has become a point of personal pride. Anything that endangers she swiftly quashes, with extreme prejudice. The hardened killers under her command are experts in the arts of crowd control and intimidation. But while she is more than happy to send others into battle, she is no stranger to violence and rarely misses an opportunity to take her spiked halberd and heavy shield to seditionists, bandits, and other undesirables.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3800#static": "The Dragonkin Empire's colonies and provinces were once governed by suzerains – officials who enforced a territory's loyalty to the Dragon Emperor. While these provinces were expected to follow the will of the Empire in dealing with other cities, they were granted some degree of autonomy in how they handled their domestic affairs. While most suzerains were Dragonkin nobles from the heart of the Empire, the burgeoning colony of Kaerok was governed by a Human – a powerful sorcerer called Katonn. \r\n\r\nOne of the highest ranking non-Dragonkin in the Empire, Katonn was not only devoted to his duty as suzerain, but to the teachings of the Eternal Dragon, Iragoth, from which he learned the fundamentals of time magic. Through intense training and instruction, Katonn had been able to drastically prolong his life. With this, he kept a firm grip over the clans of Kaerok for several decades, allowing the region to shine as a model colony for the Dragonkin Empire under his guidance.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Sin of Dragons – the Dragonkin's opening of a portal to Siroth's realm of Anathraad – changed everything. Hordes of Demonspawn poured out from the magical gateway and ransacked the Empire. Iragoth herself, who had been manipulated and tainted by Siroth, wreaked havoc and devastation. It was enough to nearly break Katonn, who had adored Iragoth and the empire, and now saw the former destroy the latter. He agonized in his search for a solution – surely his time magic could reverse all of this? As Katonn watched from afar as the Great Dragon Shrine in the empire's military capital of Twinrift exploded in a magical cataclysm, he felt a great surge of arcane energies, which he found bolstered his own great magical power. It was exactly what he needed. Not knowing how much longer this bounty of sorcerous energy would last, Katonn knew he had to quickly weave a great spell – one that he hoped would reverse the flow of time, and give him the opportunity to prevent the Dragonkin from committing their grievous sin.\r\n\r\nSealing himself in a makeshift tomb on the borders of Kaerok to isolate himself from outside distraction and interruption, Katonn channeled the unstable power that surged through him. Fighting against the great river of time, Katonn sailed upstream, hoping to reach his port of call. For what seemed like both seconds and eons, he fought against the temporal tide, until his body could take no more. He awoke inside his tomb, shuddering and exhausted from the ravages of his struggle. Within seconds he felt the weight of centuries crash down on his body, rip away his soul, and condemn him to death, only for the process to halt – stopped by an unfamiliar magic. Though he did not know it, it was Undeath. This was a sensation Katonn did not recognize, a phenomenon he did not understand. What was this power binding him?\r\n\r\nStruggling to anchor his mind, Katonn moved his body – a broken shell halted in the process of withering to dust, for reasons he could not fathom. Desperately trying to grip onto the present, Katonn unsealed the tomb's great stone door and stumbled out into what he expected to be the past. Time's flow cannot be fought, however – one can only be swept along by it. \r\n\r\nRather than traveling to a time before the Dragonkin's fatal sin, Katonn had advanced centuries or more into the future. The now-bustling kingdom of Kaerok lay before him, with its gleaming Bibliotheque Spire piercing the sky – far removed from the draconic colony he left behind. Questions flooded Katonn's mind. Once he learned that he was in a time so far from both his own and the one he had sought to find, he needed to know what had happened. Now he wanders Teleria, trying to piece together how much of his world still exists, what power has taken over his body, and to piece together some kind of purpose for himself.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3830#static": "The great schism of the High Elves and Dark Elves, and the War of the Elves that followed, were terrible things indeed, not least because it was a conflict whose rights and wrongs were never clear-cut, but also because there were no true victors. The wound torn open between the High Elves of Aravia and the Dark Elves of Durham Forest festers to this day. Nonetheless, there have been several attempts – in good faith and bad – to try to at least normalize relations, if not wholly mend the rift. In the War’s aftermath during the Age of Treachery, Lanakis the Chosen was intended to be the healing hand whose expert diplomacy would bring the two halves together once again. \r\n\r\nThe failed First Conclave of the Elves had been the spark that ignited the War, which raged so intensely that it prompted the intervention of the Arbiter and the Sacred Order. She marched an army of her loyalists right to the frontlines , threatening violence upon both belligerents if peace was not swiftly negotiated. Exhausted and depleted, the Elves agreed to a Second Conclave. Lanakis had successfully bargained various temporary ceasefires and evacuations of the vulnerable during the course of the fighting. Now she saw her chance to end the conflict outright, and eagerly accepted the nomination to be the chief negotiator of Aravia to the Second Conclave of the Elves – the Chosen. She donned a ceremonial headdress that covered her eyes, so that she might become as blind and impartial as the notion of justice itself. \r\n\r\nThe Second Conclave began promisingly enough. Civility was upheld and all the right words about peace and reconciliation were spoken. But as negotiations dragged on, tensions simmered, and the façade of cordiality was revealed to be just that: a thin veneer maintained grudgingly, hatred and contempt seething just below the surface of every interaction. Lanakis herself, for all her training in impartiality and composure, was wracked with feelings of anger and doubt. She had seen firsthand the cruelty and destruction that the Dark Elves were capable of. But, as an insider in the world of Aravian politics, she had seen too how her High Elf kinfolk had grown more and more radicalized, ever-more intolerant and egotistical, filled with paranoia and mistrust for everyone outside their personal cliques. \r\n\r\nWas the shadow magic of the Dark Elves and their enigmatic spiritual leader, the Dreamwalker, truly a force for unmitigated evil? Hearing the testimonies of Dark Elf ambassadors, and recalling her own experiences, she fully appreciated how wondrously, delightfully empowering these magics were even for dabbling practitioners. Shadowcraft had undoubtedly improved lives, but the King of Aravia, the noble court, and even the Arbiter herself had instantly and unequivocally condemned it. Though Lanakis had before respected the Arbiter’s neutrality on mortal affairs, she now questioned it. \r\n\r\nLanakis' strained faith was fully shattered when the Arbiter accused the followers of the Dreamwalker to all willingly being in league with dark lord Siroth himself. Lanakis believed it to be a wild and irresponsible accusation – an excuse to justify further war and oppression against a group who, while perhaps irresponsible and in need of legal reprimand, were nonetheless close-knit kin, still Aravian in many of their ways, with families and friends on both sides longing to be reunited. The culture of the Dark Elves had not yet shifted dramatically with the passage of time and generations. Lanakis saw the Arbiter’s accusations against the Dark Elves as an insult to all Elves, including herself. Additionally, she resented the presence of the Sacred Order. She knew of the horrors of their Red Crusade, and feared they would launch a new campaign of extermination against the Dark Elves, if the rhetoric that they were servants of Darkness were allowed to intensify. Innocent Elves would also doubtless suffer at their indiscriminate hands.\r\n\r\nMonths of deadlock wore on Lanakis’ spirit. By the time terms were finally agreed upon, Lanakis was much disillusioned. Far from mending the schism, the terms of the Second Conclave established it firmly: the territorial borders of Aravia and Durham were locked down, Dark Elves exiled from Aravia were compensated for the loss of their estates, and rules against aggressive expansion by either party were established. Peace was achieved, but it was a peace that pleased no one. Lanakis feared that there would never be another chance to reunite the Elves. And after spending ages steeped in the cynical, manipulative politics of the High Elves, The Chosen decided to follow a new path.\r\n\r\nLanakis did not return to Aravia with the delegation. She tendered her resignation and defected to the Dark Elves, where her sympathies now lay. By the very terms of the peace treaty she had helped foster, her furious former masters could do nothing to stop her.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3860#static": "Skarg was born in the bitterness of the Winterlands during the Age of Hellfire, where he learned quickly that the deeds of a man defined him, not the environment he faced. Like all Old Norr, he loved his people dearly, and learned to fight at an early age. He was a young man of courage, intelligence, wisdom, and was a born leader.\r\n\r\nSkarg was forced to use his skills sooner than he wished. After the Battle of the Waters of Life, Sorath the Frost Spider and a horde of Demonspawn descended upon his domain. Though most of the Old Norr were driven from the Winterlands after the battle, Skarg nonetheless won praise for his courage, cool head, and clever organization, which enabled thousands to flee to safety. Witnesses spoke of how he took to battle against the Demonic scourge single-handedly.\r\n\r\nMany of the surviving Old Norr fled to the Redspike Mountains, and dozens of kingdoms were established, collectively known as Frostheim. Six – of which Skarg ruled one – rapidly became more dominant than the others. To the ambitious, this time of upheaval was an opportunity to seize power, and though Skarg was highly respected, he knew that in turbulent times that could make him a target. In the end, the threat came from his own family. Skarg was ambushed by his half-brother, Rakran, who desired to become king of all the Redspikes. After a bitter fight, Skarg was left for dead. terribly wounded, he later crawled and hobbled to the valley of Queen Larah, ruler of another of the largest kingdoms, and sought refuge. Under her protection, Skarg recuperated and planned his revenge. He was determined to rid the world of his brother – but Queen Larah refused to aid him, not wishing for war. And so he traversed the Redspikes, seeking allies to fight Rakran, but during that time his half-brother invaded the queen's territory. Skarg raced to the valley, and waged a guerrilla campaign against Rakran, drawing warriors to him over many months.\r\n\r\nDespite Queen Larah’s pleas, the remaining four principal monarchs of the Redspikes refused to aid her, for all awaited the outcome of the war to see what opportunities it presented. Forced to fight alone, Larah and Skarg joined their strength. Weeks passed before they successfully drew Rakran’s army into an ambush. During the horrific bloodshed, Skarg cleaved his way to his half-brother, and in the bitter duel that followed, beheaded Rakran with his broadsword. The battle was won shortly thereafter, and Skarg reclaimed his old kingdom.\r\n\r\nThough one war had ended, peace was not brought to Frostheim. There was much jostling for land and power, and the minor kingdoms greatly resented the might of the six strongest. Skarg feared that division would leave each kingdom vulnerable to outsiders, so he gathered the Old Norr monarchs together. Rulers and their entourages nearly came to blows before Skarg rose to speak, his reputation the only thing preventing the spilling of blood. He spoke passionately about betrayal and the dangers the Norr had overcome to achieve what they had in the Redspikes, convincing them that unity and peace were greater than greed and conflict. He proposed a union of all Old Norr in the Redspikes. Disputes would be resolved peacefully and no single kingdom would ever face an attack alone. Few could deny his wisdom. Thanks to Skarg, the Confederation of Frostheim was born.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, not all were happy. Dozens of monarchs and warlords felt strong-armed into accepting a life of relative poverty in comparison to their stronger neighbors, and so invaded Kaerok to gain the wealth and status they could not find in Frostheim. This war-migration lasted for decades, with the Frostheimers defeated. Many kings and queens were killed, and in their absence, those monarchs who remained widened and consolidated their holdings so that all Frostheim was controlled by the six most powerful kingdoms. There were pitifully few returning nobles and warlords to challenge the state of affairs, and Skarg confirmed that the Confederation would have six rulers forever more.\r\n\r\nImpressed by Skarg's vision, the Arbiter came to the monarchs and gifted them a Shard. She recognized Skarg’s influence and proposed that he exchange his freedom for the immortality a Shard could offer. While he knew this meant his influence could extend beyond the length of his mortal life, Skarg knew that to acquiesce meant that he would never taste life unless called to aid his people. His agreement came with one condition – that only a ruler of Frostheim would be able to summon him.\r\n\r\nThough the Confederation has long since been replaced with the Kingdom of Frostheim, and the Winter Hall is now the haunt of the Ice Golem, Skarg’s legacy remains. His place in history is enshrined in songs that celebrate this proud warrior whose noble words and daring deeds forged a brighter future for the Redspikes. And like a sleeping giant, his power remains ready, waiting to be roused for battle again.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3870#static": "Willem Armstrong was born into a Kaerokian family of noble repute, but while his parents assumed he would follow in their footsteps as a knight of the realm, he showed a different inclination. As a child, Willem found the greatest pleasure in listening to the stories told by the family’s Lumayan priest, Halmar. Halmar told Willem tales of the Goddess of Light, regaling him with fantastical stories about the Dances of Creation and the righteous wars against the goddess’ treacherous once-suitor, Siroth the Shadow God.\r\n\r\nAs a young student, Willem enjoyed penning thoughts inspired by Halmar’s stories, and gave impromptu sermons to bemused classmates in his school yard. Halmar rejoiced that his charge seemed to have found a calling, and while Willem’s parents were not gladdened by the realization that their son would not follow in his father’s footsteps, they were devout people, and in time rejoiced that their son was embracing the worship of Lumaya so wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\nHalmar introduced Willem to the Sacred Order, who accepted him into their ranks. Willem immediately found himself at home among the holy organization’s firebrands, and became apprentice to the infamous Deacon Mailen, a ferocious old sermonizer who harbored a deep hatred of non-Humans even for a senior member of the Order. According to his tenets, Lumaya had chosen humanity as her divine instrument, and it was their destiny to one day rule all of Teleria. While Armstrong never went as far as Mailen publicly, as the zealot's favored acolyte it was difficult to imagine his views substantially differed.\r\n\r\nWhile preaching was Armstrong’s first calling, he also found battle to be a natural outlet for the zealotry that had become part of every facet of his life. He was always the first to volunteer when the Sacred Order sent its dedicated knights and warriors to hunt down the forces of Darkness and when he returned his mace was caked in gore. Willem proudly scorned every wound and injury he suffered at the hands of the unrighteous, seeing them as evidence of the strength of his faith and claiming that surviving his injuries only made him more certain of his own cause as well as Lumaya's protection.\r\n\r\nAs the years wore on, Mailen became too decrepit to preach in public. Armstrong acted as his voice, his booming orations doing the old deacon proud. When Mailen passed away, it was Armstrong who delivered the final address to the crowds of faithful mourners at the man's funeral. Soon afterwards, Willem was promoted to Mailen’s former role.\r\n\r\nDeacon Armstrong remains a potent force within the Sacred Order. His sermons are famous and draw great crowds from across Anhelt and beyond. The speeches follow the same pattern – reminding listeners of their sin, whipping them into a frenzy, then claiming that their displays of devotion are proof that Lumaya’s Light still burns within and that with prayer and donations it can blaze anew. Some state that Armstrong is a dangerous radical trying to upset the delicate political balance of Anhelt, though few within the Sacred Order would ever dream of reprimanding such a staunch proponent of their beliefs. Others think him a hypocrite who does not truly believe what he preaches. But there will be no clemency for any who make such a claim in the deacon’s presence. Even with his years now advancing, any non-believer struck by a blow from Armstrong is unlikely to survive long enough to receive a second.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3890#static": "Assassination is an everyday occurrence under the twisted canopy of Durham Forest. As night falls among the treetop homes of the Dark Elves, windows are shut, doors are guarded, and even the low-born sleep with one eye open, for death by hired blade is not restricted to the elite of Dark Elf society. The Dark Elves made great use of assassination, deception, and spycraft during the War of the Elves. After their banishment to Durham Forest, they continued to use them, only now upon each other. Bitterness, resentment, and the struggle for resources saw what little Dark Elf unity there was rapidly collapse, and now these people's skills in treachery and underhandedness have never been greater. As long as the Dark Elves see enemies in each other, Maranix will be there with an obliging blade for any who can afford her services.\r\n\r\nMaranix is more than an assassin, she is an artist of death, and her name is spoken in Durham with hushed tones and great fear. Any mark unlucky enough to be accepted by her can be sure of a cruel and merciless death. Her blades are an extension of her body and through them, Maranix can channel a dark and deadly magic few others have mastered.\r\n\r\nCult-cabals often form in Dark Elf society, for the Dark Elves are a broken people and for them, isolation equals death in their dangerous home. These organizations hold a great sway over the population of Durham Forest, and many will sell their own kin to them in exchange for favor. Among the cabals of assassins, of which Maranix controls many, blood is a form of currency, to sacrifice a life at the altar of death is considered a great honor. Maranix considers herself a priestess in service to death. To her every kill is a form of worship, every slice of a blade a sacrament, every stab a litany. When a buyer crosses her palm with silver, they can be certain of their enemy’s doom.\r\n\r\nHow Maranix came to live among assassins is a mystery. Perhaps she was an innocent babe sold into a cruel faith as payment for services rendered, or her parents intended the girl to be slaughtered, offered up as a sacrifice to assuage dark fates. Whether by the whims of destiny or some dark designs by the cabal of assassins she was abandoned to, death in childhood was not to be Maranix's. She was kept, and tutored.\r\n\r\nThose who taught Maranix saw early that the girl lacked something fundamental in her soul. She was a strange child who never moaned, never cried, and never played. She sat for hours in prayer, often forgoing food and drink in her apparent reverence of death. The first time she was sent to kill she returned with such a fervent glee that put fear even into the black hearts of her callous tutors. The fear that took root in her teachers' hearts was not unfounded. Maranix took intense pleasure in dispatching her targets with the cruelty and zeal of a true fanatic. Her skill with a blade soon became greater than that of even the greatest of the assassin-priests, and as time passed she outsmarted her tutors in more and more lessons and she came to see them as weak. Why should she be commanded by those she could kill? Maranix decided she should be the one who led. She plotted and executed the murder of her masters until all who stood in her way were dead. With every corpse, Maranix proved herself the greater killer. None dared oppose her ascension to mistress of her temple.\r\n\r\nMaranix’s soaring ambition did not only extend to ruling her own institution. Many others offered death for payment in Durham Forest. She wanted to dominate them all. She led a campaign of terror against numerous rival cabals, a war fought in back rooms, in bed chambers, in guild halls, and on the streets. Some of her victims did not even know they were targets before it was too late. Maranix made no secret of her murders. Each of the dead was found with her sigil carved into their flesh, a message written in blood for any who dared oppose the self-declared new queen of assassins. \r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of this slaughter, many of those lucky enough to be left alive pledged fealty to Maranix. Now she stands at the pinnacle of her field. None can say what marks she will take but any who seek alliance with the mistress of death would do well to tread lightly. Maranix needs no friends, and she has no loyalty for customers who may well be tomorrow’s prey.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3900#static": "Before he was a Skinwalker, Ukko was an Orc of note among his own remote tribe in the lush but dangerous Lost Isles, far beyond Kaerok’s gentle coastal shores. A prodigious consumer of shamanic wisdom and hearty meals alike, Ukko’s appetite for all forms of power and knowledge led to a misadventure in the deepest reaches of his home island’s dense and mountainous jungle. Coming upon a lost temple, Ukko was attacked by a strange, ancient boar-beast of fearsome power, which seemed, though half-mad, to be bent on guarding the place’s inscrutable secrets. Badly wounded but victorious, Ukko contracted the Skinwalker curse from his wounds and the mingling of his and the creature’s spilled blood. He lost consciousness and his flesh reformed into a new, boar-like state. As he returned to rationality, he endured a series of painful re-awakenings, each followed by the same terrible realization. Whenever he caught a glimpse of his transformation in a puddle or polished bit of stone, his conscious mind was sent fleeing into an atavistic state of rage and panic. The beast within would eventually subside, leaving Ukko to discover the aftermath of yet another frightful rampage he did not remember. \r\n\r\nThis cycle could have broken his mind. Instead, he remembered the lessons of self-mastery and moderation that his mentors in the shamanic arts had always taught him. He had never seen the true value of their advice, until he had to draw upon it in this crisis. Putting them into practice, he finally stopped his unconscious rages, and set his eyes upon the ruins and the jungle with sound and clear mind again at last. The now boar-like Ukko still yearned to satisfy his curiosity, and discover the truth of the temple ruin that seemed more ancient than any structure he had ever seen or touched. So he spent some time in the ruins, coming to terms with the changes to his mind and body and studying what little he could of the glyphs and signs within the temple. \r\n\r\nHe could not find any information about his curse, the boar guardian, or the temple’s original builders. But he gleaned a few precious secrets of magic from that primeval place, enough to elevate his refined but limited spell-craft. Powers of life and death, the flow and storage of that power, and the totemic works required – the things that Ukko craved were finally his, at least to some extent. He was still left with the sting of curiosity unsated, and it remained when he broke his self-imposed exile from within the temple.\r\n\r\nBut Ukko could not face the idea of returning to the village of his upbringing. He could not risk approaching his close-knit community in this strange new form, which he knew required constant vigilance to control. So, rather than return, he did something his people always warned against – hail one of the merchant vessels of Arnoc that occasionally did business in the Lost Isles. Among the seasoned crew who had sailed far and seen much, this strange native Skinwalker was unusual to be sure, but not so bizarre as to preclude accommodation, especially when Ukko’s brews and chants healed one of their sick. He sampled their rations and found them bland, but the delicacies from the mainland proffered to him were delicious. There was knowledge there too, among the so-called civilized folk, and thought perhaps somewhere on the continent of Anhelt, he could find out more about the curse that turned him. So from bustling Arnoc, past the ruins of Narbuk, and through the treacherous Durham Forest he wandered north, sharing tales and insights freely. He expected the same in return, doing favors for monks and peddlers in exchange for meals and knowledge, and sometimes performing purifying rituals. \r\n\r\nIn time, Ukko’s name and reputation came to precede him, and he found fame to his liking. It seemed to only offer him more and more opportunities to learn. When asked about his shamanic formulae, his secrets and insights, he would simply refer to ‘Ukko’s blessing,’ ‘Ukko’s wrath,’ and so forth. After all, his mentors had taught him much, but with all that he had learned and endured, Ukko had made his magic truly his own. He kept his public persona close to the model of an overconfident, naïve, small-minded islander, which served to mask his true intellect and ambitions. And so tales of the ‘Mighty Ukko’, all the more easy to spread for their simplicity, began to proliferate and give growing weight to his name. But he has not deviated from his original purpose. Having learned much of Skinwalkers in his travels but nothing of the curse’s cure, he now approaches the storied lands of Aravia, home of the High Elves. How their sensibilities and his will clash remains to be seen.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3910#static": "The Orc Nogdar is known by many sinister names – Blood Neck, the Headhunter, Brother Butcher, and the Headsman are just a few of his foreboding titles. But while they are used across Teleria, it is among his own kind that Nogdar is most infamous. Many Orcs believe that Nogdar is no mortal but an avenging spirit, sent by the ancestors to wreak death and destruction on those deserving of it.\r\n\r\nBut it was not always so, according to the legend. The Headhunter was the weakest son born to Shashrak, an Orc general who commanded a Gaellen Pact army during its war against the Telerian League. With his many older brothers competing for their father’s attention, Nogdar believed he could never gain Shashrak’s approval, much less his appreciation. But Shashrak was not as oblivious to his fatherly duties as he first appeared. Though he did not talk of it, he watched his youngest and weakest son closely, waiting to see if a day would come when he would prove himself.\r\n\r\nThat day came shortly after the Gaellen defeat at the Battle of Mourncliff. Having launched his flanking maneuver too early and against orders, Skarrow, Shashrak’s eldest son, bore the blame for the defeat. He further compounded his failure by coming to blows with his father. Skarrow was punished with exile, but the arrogant son would not accept it. Shashrak was left with no choice but to sentence his son to death. But Skarrow remained popular among the Orcs of his father's army, and Shashrak could find none who would carry out the sentence – until Nogdar stepped forward.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was driven by bitterness toward his siblings, or perhaps he merely wished to prove his worth and dedication to his father. Either way, when he beheaded his older brother, Nogdar sealed his own fate as surely as he did Skarrow’s. While he had carried out Shashrak’s orders and earned his respect, he had likewise secured the enmity of the rest of his kin, and a huge number of Orc warriors besides.\r\n\r\nThe war continued to go against the Pact. At the disastrous Battle of Blood Crag, Shashrak himself was cut down. Without his firm leadership, the Pact army that had fought under him disintegrated.\r\n\r\nShashrak’s death should have spelled doom for Nogdar, for the first thing his surviving older brothers did was find him. They cornered and attacked him near Blood Crag, but Nogdar proved far more dangerous than they had anticipated. He faced them down, fighting and besting the oldest and strongest before the others reached him. Jagro the Knife was next, but Grull and Horndax – the two remaining siblings – were finally able to drag Nogdar to the ground.\r\n\r\nThere the matter might have ended, left as a cautionary tale for all Orcs, but this was not the last of Nogdar. Certainly, the popular accounts hold to a sinister belief that, though all those who knew him believed Nogdar was slain and his body burned, he has been seen stalking those who have wronged him.\r\n\r\nAt first, it is said, Grull and Horndax scorned rumors of Nogdar’s return, but they had little time to regret their foolishness, for the Brother Butcher came for them both in turn, defeating them and cutting the heads from their shoulders. Taking the blood from his brothers’ corpses, Nogdar circled his neck with lines of the thick fluid, one for each of the siblings he had slain.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth, the legend of the Headhunter has prevailed. Nogdar has been reported appearing among his fellow-Orcs unannounced, offering to hunt and kill those who have wronged his chosen allies. He speaks little, and when he does his voice is a deathly scrape. Down the years, his ax has blackened with the viscera of those he has executed, and he always refreshes the blood on his torso, daubing the vital essence of his latest victim over the deep stain of his war paint. Learned non-Orcs who have heard the many tales of Nogdar posit that he may be an agent of the Arbiter, saved from death at the hands of his brothers at the last minute by the hallowed agent of Lumaya. Many Orcs scoff at the notion, but it is a belief gaining traction.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3930#static": "Kreela Witch-Arm was born in a small village in the Lost Isles, under the stars her clan believed signified sorrow and ancestry. The first star proved true all too soon, for Kreela’s mother died in childbirth. The second star marked her as one with ‘Hallowsight’: a connection and ability to commune with the Orc realm of spirits. Soon after Kreela’s birth, a Shaman called Tellok arrived in their village demanding the girl be handed over to her, so that she may be properly trained in the spiritual practices the Orcs of her home islands had observed for generations. Facing losing both his wife and daughter in a matter of days, Kreela’s father refused. Furious, the Shaman cursed the child, and vibrant fuchsia, mauve, and lilac flames erupted from Kreela’s left arm, forever marking her as one who refused the call of the ancestors. Fearful of provoking Tellok any further, the village elders banished Kreela and her father.\r\n\r\nKreela’s father sought shelter for them among other Orc clans. They roamed from village to village, isle to isle, and the response was always the same: a firm refusal to welcome the child with the witch-arm. Realizing that she would never be accepted, Kreela’s father accepted life as an outcast, and did his best to raise his daughter with love and optimism for a better life to come. Though their existence was harsh, Kreela grew into a happy, headstrong, and fearsome young Orc, skilled with any weapon, and adept at hunting, fishing, and surviving in the wilderness. When she was old enough to understand, Kreela’s father told her of Shaman Tellok, and how, despite the curse, they would build a better life together. However, a time came when the star of sorrow proved prophetic once more. As Kreela was on the cusp of adolescence, a terrible sickness claimed her father’s life. She wailed and howled for hours until exhaustion overcame her. Kreela collapsed beside her father’s body, and fell into a deep and mournful sleep.\r\n\r\nAfter opening her eyes, it was clear to Kreela that she was no longer in the cave in which she was raised. The landscape before her seemed to shift, images appearing then disappearing in mists as if drawn and erased by some spectral illustrator. It was unlike anything she had ever experienced, and though she may only have been dreaming, Kreela thought that somehow she had passed over into the ancestral plane. Unsure of what to do, or what was expected of her, she stood up and inspected this dreamlike place. As she explored, the landscape continued to blur and change, until she saw two Orcish figures, holding hands and walking toward the horizon. She chased quickly, eager to speak, but as she ran the figures seemed to become further away. Then, just as they were almost out of sight, the pair turned. Kreela’s heart almost jumped out of her chest as she saw they were her father and an Orc that looked just like her, except older and without the cursed arm. The stranger gave her a tender smile and Kreela knew she was seeing her mother for the first time.\r\n\r\nAt that very moment, Kreela sat bolt upright, now back in the cave. Filled with immense grief, yet fizzing with a newfound purpose, she knew that she had to find Shaman Tellok and learn from her, so that she may again visit the ancestral plane and speak with her parents. Though it pained her to go to the one who cursed her, the one whom her father had lost everything to keep her away from, Kreela knew that she had to forge her own path, and accept the fate that the stars had laid out for her at her birth. When she found Tellok in a remote hut on an otherwise unpopulated island, the Shaman wasn’t surprised to see the adolescent Orc standing there, for the spirits had told her of Kreela’s coming moons prior. They began training immediately, Tellok keen to make up for lost time, and Kreela eager to learn.\r\n\r\nYears passed, and Kreela honed her craft and widened her understanding of the rituals, spells, and practices passed down from Shaman to Shaman. Over time Kreela’s power outstripped Tellok’s, yet despite countless attempts, she could not reach that dreamlike place where she had seen her parents. With the old Shaman unable to teach her any more, Kreela set out on her own, desperate to find any clue or magic that might allow her to once again find her family. Lost and alone, she uses her gifts to seek something she may never find, her travels most recently taking her to the pirate port of Bleakhaven. Perhaps one day Kreela will snap out of her introspection, and she will find a new purpose looking outward to the future, instead of inward to the past.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3980#static": "South of the Krokhan Desert lies Ireth, a city steeped in wealth and history, a shining jewel of civilization. Or, rather, it was, before the rise of Bad-el-Kazar and the darkening of Ireth in the Age of Treachery. The mage academies that once produced the finest wizards, sorcerers, and spellcasters the world had ever seen are now reduced to squabbling fiefdoms, ruled by madmen. What was once a storehouse of knowledge has become a repository of nightmares. And first among their number is Vizier Ovelis. \r\n\r\nThough Ireth is still nominally ruled by Bad-el-Kazar, the mage city's necromantic Grandmaster, in reality he does so in name only, as for many years he has been absent, doing whatever he or Siroth whims. And so the onerous task of governance falls to his many viziers, who have portioned out Ireth to best suit themselves even as they make covert war upon one another in an effort to take complete control of the city. Ovelis is among the most powerful of their number, as well as one of the most corrupt. \r\n\r\nBut it was not always so. In the years following Bad-el-Kazar’s return from his expedition to the Winterlands, Ireth fell into chaos. It became rife with factionalism and fanaticism in equal measure, leading to blood on the streets and a complete disruption in the city’s studies. Something had to be done, and Ovelis knew that he was the only one with the foresight to see it done properly. He had survived the brutal politics of the academies, surely running a city could be no worse than that.\r\n\r\nOvelis spent his days rooting out sedition and ensuring that the Grandmaster’s control of the city remained intact and the selfish desires of the grand scholars and mages did not win out. But it was a thankless task, and Ovelis grew fearful that his hard work was unappreciated by his fellow viziers. Worse, that their resentment of his heavy-handed approach outweighed their fear. He suspected that his own spies were secretly in the employ of his rivals, and that his orders were not being carried out, or worse, compromised. Surrounded by enemies both overt and hidden, imagined or otherwise, Ovelis realized he could only count on himself. \r\n\r\nOvelis concluded that the only way to survive was to be both the hand that wields the dagger, and the dagger itself. Thus, he delved into those magics which had been forbidden before Bad-el-Kazar’s reign and performed eldritch rituals, seeking some way of being in two or more places at once. It was a mad quest, a fool’s errand, and a sign of the degradation of Ovelis’ once-keen mind, awash in fear and frustration… and yet, it was successful. After many nights of study, he conjured a duplicate of himself; a semi-sentient entity that resembled him in every way, save that it was formed of shadow substance.\r\n\r\nOverjoyed, and perhaps a trifle relieved, Ovelis unleashed his creation on his enemies that very evening. The Shadow-Ovelis stalked the streets of Ireth, hunting for those who dared pit themselves against the vizier as well as those whom Ovelis merely suspected of doing so. What followed was a night of slaughter unlike any Ireth has ever endured before or since. Dozens of Ovelis’ fellow viziers were murdered in their private quarters or in the laboratories; seditious mages were butchered in the streets and alleyways; recalcitrant officials were found in their bedchambers, bloated with poison. \r\n\r\nBut when morning dawned, and the umbral assassin returned to its master… something happened. What that something was is unknown to all save Ovelis himself, though servants reported the sounds of the vizier arguing 'with himself', followed by a blood-curdling scream. \r\n\r\nAfterwards, Ovelis took to wearing an intricately wrought mask and all-concealing robes, as if trying to hide some disfigurement. Nor did he deign to speak with his fellow viziers face to face again, despite their best efforts. No longer could he be drawn into the plots and schemes of his peers. Strangest of all, he made no effort to rebuild his spy networks. \r\n\r\nDespite this, Ovelis suffered no lack of information on the doings of the city’s inhabitants. Indeed, some said it was as if he now had an ear in every chamber and a knife in every shadow. Yet he made no attempt to increase his power. \r\n\r\nRather, he is seemingly content to leave such squabbling to the other viziers. So long as they keep such matters contained to themselves, Ovelis pays them little heed. For their part, the other viziers make sure to do so, and keep any thought of treachery to themselves. For anyone who threatens the relative peace of Ireth vanishes, leaving only empty rooms and the echo of fading screams…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=3990#static": "Most Demonic servants of Siroth take on the trappings of mortal existence. Many were once mortals who pledged themselves to the Shadow God, and it seems to amuse some Firstborn Demons to mimic the ways of the so-called civilized peoples of Teleria, especially when it comes to the courts of highborn nobles. But there are some among Demon-kind who do not attempt to gild themselves with the ways of those they seek to conquer. They use no veneer of humanity and make no concessions to civility or reason. They embrace what they are, malicious and wicked beings with cold hungers and fiery tempers. Few are as primal as the Demon known as Candraphon, who only uses a mortal form for the purpose of entering Teleria.\r\n\r\nA Firstborn, Candraphon has served Siroth since before the creation of mortals. With his great age and the power and stature it affords him amongst his Demonic kin, Candraphon does not act like most other Firstborn who dedicate so much of their existence to attempting to control their fellow Demonspawn. Not for him the politicking and backstabbing of Siroth’s grand court in Anathraad, nor the much-coveted generalship of the Demonspawn armies that seek to conquer and subvert Teleria. Candraphon does not manipulate his kind for his benefit, clash against them over matters of primacy, seek alliances with them, nor even seem to care for the favor of Siroth. He has but one passion, one need which he can never fully satiate – the hunting of mortals.\r\n\r\nTo that end, Candraphon spends most of his time in the mortal plane, rather than in Anathraad where he would disdain the company of his power-hungry Demonspawn brethren. All he wishes to do is find worthy prey, track it, kill it, and claim trophies from its corpse. In this, Candraphon is without equal among his kind, and perhaps among any being, mortal or immortal, across Teleria. With his senses he can detect the slightest movement of his prey from great distances and can follow their scent for many leagues. His reflexes are razor-sharp, his strength a match for the biggest and most brutal fellow-Demonspawn. The only tools he makes use of are the scythe gauntlets known as the Eviscerators, great lengths of Anathraad-warped bone that cleave through anything they touch, be it steel, timber, flesh, or stone.\r\n\r\nCandraphon has become a dark legend across Teleria, and with good reason. The Demonspawn is a phantom in the dark, a whisper on the wind, an unseen presence haunting the treetops or the moorlands. No lock will keep him barred, no horse will outrun him, and a citadel-worth of guards and soldiers will not keep him at bay. He seems to delight in the tracking as much as the kill, sometimes hounding his prey for weeks or months at a time – even if he could have killed them earlier – until terror and exhaustion renders them unable to go on.\r\n\r\nCandraphon’s choice of victims has led some to speculate that he often seeks out opponents worthy of his efforts. He has clashed strength and wits with a vast array of skilled and mighty foes throughout the ages, from huntsmen in Yakai, to Elven mages of Aravia, and questing knights of Kaerok. Few have given him pause, let alone beaten him. But Candraphon does not limit himself only to great warriors or sorcerers, for if he did his legend would surely not have spread as it has. The humble farmer who hears a commotion among his livestock as darkness falls is as much in danger as the noble warrior who stops on the road to rest and water his horses, catching the strange clicking from Candraphon’s beak-like mouth on the wind.\r\n\r\nThe latest stories involving the Demonspawn claim that Candraphon has taken to hunting through the dreaded Durham Forest, delighting in the variety and viciousness of the prey there. Others say that the infamous figure Ruel the Huntsmaster, one of the deadliest Dark Elves ever to have lived, has heard of Candraphon, and seeks him out to test his skills. If such stories are true, Candraphon may have found something close to his match – certainly their clash will become legend. One thing is for sure: only one will leave Durham Forest alive.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4010#static": "The Nomads of the Krokhan Desert are infamous for their ferocity in battle, as well as their independent, if cantankerous, nature. Only rarely can they come to agreement, and disagreements are often settled by battle. There are grudges between clans that stretch back centuries. Were it not for these enmities, the clans might have forged a realm to rival that of Aravia or Kaerok. \r\n\r\nYet on those rare occasions when grudges are put aside in favor of unity, a warlord known as a High Khatun is chosen to lead the unified tribes to war. This individual must exemplify those traits that the Nomads hold in high esteem: ferocity in battle, courageous in the face of opposition, wisdom to know when not to attack, charisma, and of indomitable will. While many Nomad chieftains can claim some of these traits, few have them all. It is a rare warrior who can rise to the position of High Khatun, and an even rarer one who can hold it for any length of time before they are toppled by defeat, betrayal, or simple circumstance. Over the centuries, several have joined the Arbiter and entered a Shard before such an event can occur.\r\n\r\nThe rise of a High Khatun is never predictable. Some individuals have given themselves the title when they led their people in wars of conquest upon neighboring clans of Nomads. Others were sent on quests into the deepest quarters of the desert, to return with the heads of deadly beasts as proof of their right to be named High Khatun. Still others had the title bestowed upon them by their fellow chieftains when the tribes were faced with an existential threat. \r\n\r\nPerasha the Falcon, the High Khatun who led the Nomads when the corrupted academy city of Ireth attempted one of its periodic expansions into their territory, was one such warrior. The armies of Ireth had slain hundreds of Nomads and captured more in a matter of days. A conclave of chieftains was called, for every Nomad recognized that no clan could stand against the horrific might of the dark academy city alone. \r\n\r\nThe chieftains knew that they had to choose one from among their number to act as the leader of the horde. After some debate, they chose the youngest, Perasha. No fool, Perasha knew that she had not been chosen for her reputation or charm, but because her clan was among the least influential. The other chieftains had no wish to bow to her for longer than it took to defeat Ireth, and intended that she be a figurehead only. Perasha, however, was determined to show that though her people lacked the power of some of the other clans, they were no less worthy of respect. \r\n\r\nTo that end, Perasha led a series of daring raids on the Irethi encampments, drawing the enemy forces into the desert where the other clans picked them apart at their convenience. So successful was Perasha’s strategy that the chieftains who had elevated her grew nervous even as they cheered her victories, fearing that she might attempt to unify the clans under her banner for good. They resolved that once the war was done, so too would the High Khatun’s life end. \r\n\r\nTo this day, the circumstances of Perasha’s death are a matter of some debate among the clans. Some claim she was slain on the eve of Ireth’s defeat by a sorcerous assassin who attacked from the shadows. Others insist she was felled by an arrow in the back. Whatever the reason given, all agree that it was for the best. A High Khatun is a fine thing to have, but only when absolutely necessary.",

His hunger is for rot and ruin and it can never be sated, ever since a scheming Demonspawn exploited Yaga’s formerly kind and selfless nature during some of the darkest days of the Skinwalker people. \r\n\r\nIn the Age of Treachery, the Sacred Order stoked the fires of hate against Skinwalkers and the Red Crusade erupted and spread like a virus across the world. Across Anhelt. Skinwalkers were killed or exiled enmasse, along with foreigners, sympathizers, and many other kinds of non-Humans in general. Yaga and his found family of Skinwalker outcasts escaped, thanks to the maritime smugglers of the Lost Isles, who deposited them on the shores of the inhospitable, haunted Stormwind Wastes. Cut off from essential medicines and supplies, malnutrition and disease wracked the group as they tried to make their way north toward the Sorrowlakes, where they had heard that other refugees were gathering. Yaga, a herbalist by trade, did everything he could to alleviate their suffering and treat their symptoms, but had little to work with amid the desolate badlands of the Wastes. In his moments of greatest despair, Yaga cursed the world for its cruel indifference, swearing that no one in all the universe cared for their plight, not even a Demon. But he was in the accursed land of Stormwind, and if he wished even ironically to have a Demon come to aid him, he should not have done so lightly.\r\n\r\nOne dark night, Yaga was weak from overexertion and most of his comrades lay stricken in their sickbeds. He felt death closing in on them all. It was then a noxious swarm of carrion flies descended before Yaga and gathered into an insect-humanoid form, its voice raspy and oozing. It was Vildrax, the arch-fiend Demonspawn called the Duke of Flies. Vildrax told Yaga that, just as the maggot will eat gangrenous flesh and leave healthy tissue behind, he could provide a similarly apparently disgusting – but effective – remedy. If Yaga swore allegiance to him, he would grant the tribe his restorative symbiotes, but each of those cured would in turn owe fealty to the Duke. To give his people a chance, any at all, Yaga agreed. Vildrax spread a reeking slime upon Yaga’s brow, and anointed his fingers with it, and bade him do the same to his fevered, delirious patients. This Yaga did, and then he too collapsed, wracked by the effects of the Demonspawn’s twisted cure. \r\n\r\nAfter long writhing hours of struggle, the Skinwalkers all awoke in the dawnlight, one by one, their fevers broken, Vildrax gone. Within a day they felt healthy, even strong. Yaga counted it a miracle. On the second day, Yaga and his tribe felt manic, invincible. Something rippled and wriggled under each of the Skinwalkers' skin, but they paid it no mind. On the third day, Yaga's and the bodies of his former friends were fully ripened by the horrid spawn of Vildrax, into breeding grounds for his brood of unholy insects. Their minds and senses dulled to the horror of their new affliction by the Duke’s curse, they vaguely recalled their goal of finding a new home.\r\n\r\nLike a droning insect drawn by the pheromones of its kind, Yaga and his tribe marched into a portal to Anathraad. Ever since, they have emerged in Teleria at Vildrax's beck and call, heralded by clouds of flies and leaving behind rot and infestation. Yaga and his fellow Skinwalkers have never forgotten their initial desire to reach the Sorrowlakes, and may yet unleash themselves upon that luckless region...",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4030#static": "Not all stories have a happy ending, and sometimes even the most hopeful can turn dark. So it could have been with Athel, a hero of Light.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Athel’s early years with the Sacred Order suggested that a life of unquestioning faith might not be her fate. As an initiate, her honest nature was matched by a headstrong streak. She showed particular disregard when it came to delving into matters her superiors considered off-limits. The Arbiter visited her to encourage her to further discoveries, but what if a darker apparition had claimed Athel’s attention? \r\n\r\nWhat if, prompted instead by a spirit of shadow masquerading as light, she discovered something foul in the caverns beneath the Eternal Citadel, something that turned her away from the righteous path she has otherwise walked? Breaking into the wrong sealed chamber, she would have found a scene of horror – bodies littering a musty space, ancient-looking husks twisted in death-agonies. A place so redolent with evil, that Athel should have fled...\r\n\r\n…But before she could do so, a brilliant light shone forth, coalescing into the figure of a woman. She was clad in the white vestments of a Sacred Order priestess, and wore a serene-looking mask. Introducing herself as Elegaius, she claimed to be a transcended spirit seeking out a direct connection with Lumaya. As part of her quest, she had once organized a great, holy service in this very chamber, but forces of Darkness had interrupted her efforts. With Athel’s aid however, Elegaius hoped that the service could be repeated, this time successfully.\r\n\r\nNaively captivated by the priestess, Athel accepted. Over the following months she spoke to many fellow initiates, convincing them to gather at an appointed hour in the old chamber. As Athel led the service, Elegaius materialized and a deep magical connection formed between them, but it swiftly became apparent something was wrong. The light around her was rotten, and her mask was now a black and terrible visage.\r\n\r\nAthel realized she had been misled. As the screams of the other initiates filled her ears, she tried to break her link with Elegaius, but could not. The souls of her friends were torn from their bodies, feeding the corrupt spirit as Athel, overwhelmed by the magical backlash of the connection, collapsed.\r\n\r\nWhen Athel awoke among the corpses, she found her flesh pale and cold, her body unfeeling. To her horror she realized that her heart was no longer beating. \r\n\r\nAthel had no time to come to terms with her Undeath. Knights of the Order stormed the chamber and tried to seize her. Acting on self preservation, she raised her hands, unleashing the dark magics that now suffused her body. She was shocked at the necromantic energies that answered her call, but also could not help but feel awe at their power. They caused the flesh of the knights to rot from their bones. As they decomposed before her, Athel fled, pursued by more of her erstwhile comrades.\r\n\r\nOut in the wilderness, Athel was again visited by Elegaius. While Athel railed against her, the corrupt priestess showed her that there was only one way to undo what had now been done. Only through their immortality could either of them possibly find the time needed to break the veil and establish true contact with Lumaya – according to Elegaius, the Goddess of Light could then end the wider blight of Undeath. This twisted reasoning, coupled with the addictive nature of the dark magics that had taken root in her, saw Athel come to embrace her new destiny as a knight of Undeath. \r\n\r\nThankfully for Teleria, this possibility is a mere fable.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4040#static": "Once, the Dark Elves considered themselves philosophers and revolutionaries; they alone were willing to test the ancient traditions of Aravia, and delve into that which was forbidden by their more timid kin. Much has changed since then. The idealism of the past has given way to a brutal pragmatism that many Dark Elves view as necessary for their survival in the aftermath of the civil war and the split between what would become High Elf and Dark Elf societies. \r\n\r\nBut some among them still hold fast to the ideals of the past. The enigmatic warrior known as Foli is one. He was among the first to be visited in his dreams by the spirit known as the Dreamwalker, and also among the first to learn the secrets of shadow magic. Unfortunately for Foli, he was also among the first to be exiled for what the greater Elven society of Aravia saw as a dangerous obsession. Forced to leave his kith and kin behind, he fled Aravia for Ireth, seeking sanctuary with his cousin, Ovelis, before the advent of Bad-el-Kazar and Ireth’s fall to darkness. \r\n\r\nFoli continued his studies in Ireth with a zeal that bordered on fanaticism, until even the mages and sorcerers of that city became alarmed, none more so than Ovelis. He retracted his offer of sanctuary and demanded that Foli depart. Foli did so, but not before having made his first breakthrough in learning to fully manipulate shadow-stuff. \r\n\r\nThrough study and discipline, Foli honed his magic into something unique; rather than using it to attack his foes or hide, he instead used it to protect himself, turning his own shadow into a suit of armor unlike any other. A living carapace of ever-shifting shadow-substance, it provided Foli with exceptional protection and an unnatural vitality. It could resist crushing blows that should have shattered bone and pulverized flesh and any wounds he suffered healed almost instantly. Nor did Foli need weapons, for the armor could produce a sliver of darkness that would take the form of any sort of blade or bludgeon he might require. Indeed, after so many years within the armor, it was debatable that Foli was even an Elf anymore. Rather, he had become a strange, symbiotic entity – a thing of flesh and shadow. \r\n\r\nBut even this wonder wasn’t enough for Foli. He needed to learn more. He traveled across Teleria, seeking out places of forbidden knowledge and ancient magics. He delved into forgotten places, and learned more than any mortal being about the true nature of the Darkness and the Light. As he did so, his perception of the circumstances of his exile changed. \r\n\r\nAt first, Foli had been as resentful as any of his fellow exiles. After all, though he’d broken Aravian law, what harm had he truly done? In Ireth, he nurtured dreams of revenge, of returning to Aravia in triumph, his mastery of shadow magic undeniable and irresistible. \r\n\r\nBut as Foli learned more about the magic he had devoted his life to, and watched his people tear themselves apart in the internecine conflict that became known as the War of the Elves, he had an epiphany. Perhaps it came to him in a dream; or maybe some spirit whispered it to him during his quest. Regardless, he realized that his ire was aimed in the wrong direction. \r\n\r\nHis troubles were not the result of political rivals, fearful administrators or those who feared the corrupting nature of shadow magic, but rather had originated from a single source – the Dreamwalker. The Dreamwalker was the source of all Foli’s ills, and by extension, the ills of Elvenkind. And so, Foli determined the Dreamwalker would be made to pay. \r\n\r\nIn the decades that followed, Foli sought out a means to accomplish his goal. Eventually, his quest attracted the attention of the Arbiter, who visited him one night as he hovered between wakefulness and sleep. \r\n\r\nShe revealed the Dreamwalker’s true identity as Siroth, and explained how he had manipulated the Elves into tearing their own society apart. Foli had little hesitation in believing her, for much of what she said confirmed his findings in his own investigation. But what could Foli do against such a being? \r\n\r\nThe Arbiter understood his concern, but saw in Foli’s need for vengeance a chance to hamper Siroth’s designs. She spoke to him of others who shared his desire to stop Siroth, and how together they might be able to prevent the Darkness from consuming Teleria. The two spoke long into the night, and when morning dawned, the Arbiter was gone and Foli was ready to begin his guerrilla campaign to uproot the servants of Darkness and upend Siroth’s schemes wherever he could.",

From birth they were bred to look down on any beneath them. Yannica was a formidable sorceress and a skilled warrior, and her snobbery and sense of self-importance were renowned. She made many enemies, and even those ostensibly on her side during the War of the Elves were loath to work with her.\r\n\r\nTold that she would become the greatest mage of all time by her tutors, Yannica desired anything that would show up her fellow spellcasters. Setting someone on fire? How blasé. Freezing them solid? Child's play. Yannica wanted to wield magic that would make her victims and servant’s eyes pop out of their heads – quite literally in some cases. She scoured every ancient tome, codex, and grimoire she could get her hands on, hunting for that spell that would make her the talk of the magical world. If she could marry that with her desire to crush the upstart Dark Elves that terrorized Aravian society and threatened to tear down centuries of Elven accomplishments, even better.\r\n\r\nYannica’s breakthrough came in the form of an invisibility spell, which she realized would be perfect for infiltrating Dark Elven encampments and supply hoards, as well as Dreamwalker cult gatherings. While she was able to cast this on herself without difficulty, she had less success casting the illusion on others – she found she could not sustain the magic for long. It was, of course, she said, not down to her inexperience as a mage – it was in some way due to the incompetence of her followers. She told herself it did not matter – she would make the spell work when she needed to. \r\n\r\nDuring the war, a High Elf army launched an assault to oust a host of Dark Elves from the Shimmering Plateau. Yannica was tasked with using this as a distraction to allow her and her warriors to infiltrate the foe’s encampment. Their goal was to seize maps, papers, and correspondence. Yannica decided she would not cast her invisibility spell until the very last moment, partly because she could not apparently trust her followers, but also – a reason she held more privately – to conserve her strength.\r\n\r\nYannica’s band made considerable progress, slitting the throats or magically freezing multiple Dark Elf sentries before they were identified. Shadow bolts and black arrows flew, striking down several Aravians. The High Elves raced toward their foe blades ready, and cut down many Dark Elves, but were all surprised by the tenacity of their enemy, whom they had all seen as little more than envious gutter trash. Unable to gain more ground, Yannica weaved her prototype spell in frustration, forcing more energies into it than she ever had before, causing her and her allies to vanish into thin air.\r\n\r\nAs the Dark Elves scrambled to find their newly disappeared enemies, Yannica and her followers struck, cutting down foe after foe.\r\n\r\nThe High Elves pushed on deeper into the Dark Elf fort, and they could hear the din of battle in the distance. Ahead were hastily erected huts and tattered tents where they might find what they were searching for. The Dark Elf rearguard had been pulled into the ongoing clash, leaving much unguarded, and Yannica’s warriors stormed every shelter they could find. They recovered troves of valuable information. They had triumphed. Yannica wanted to be seen when the van of the High Elf army reached them, to present the commander with what she had found. She planned a great spectacle. She would cease her invisibility spell at the perfect time so that she and her band would materialize before the commander’s very eyes.\r\n\r\nBut when the time came, and Yannica attempted to undo her spell, her followers reappeared, but she did not. She was horrified. She had to be seen by all as the fantastic arcanist she knew she was. It took much effort to restore herself to visibility, and by the time she succeeded any hope she’d had in making a dramatic display to impress the commander had passed. She thanked Yannica politely for her efforts, but said nothing more before moving on.\r\n\r\nWhat made matters worse for Yannica was that she later discovered that even a small drop in her concentration caused her form to flicker and fade. Somehow she had forced the invisibility magic so intensely that it had become all but permanent. From that day forward she was forced to remain ever vigilant and sacrifice a portion of her enormous power to hide her mistake. All so that she could be seen.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4110#static": "Following the horrors of the Red Crusade, many Orcs fled to the continent of Peltas, their number fracturing into warring clans as they journeyed east over the Valdemar Strait. Some continued their journey to the Sorrowlakes with their Lizardmen, Skinwalker, and Ogryn compatriots, others became merciless raiders, and more attempted to establish a home within the Deadlands. Teela was born into a clan that headed into that hot, scrubby place, and preferred the path of the raider, pillaging and enslaving at will.\r\n\r\nLife in the clan was often brutal and short, and after being orphaned when she could barely walk Teela had to learn to survive from the moment she took her first steps. Where more fortunate warriors had the benefit of family to teach them and help, she fought for absolutely everything – food, medicine, and clothing. Despite her brutal upbringing, over the years it made Teela resourceful and strong. She gained a reputation among her clan for being able to put down warriors twice her size, and was placed at the head of countless raiding parties.\r\n\r\nFor years, Teela launched successful sorties in the Deadlands, ambushing trade convoys from Anhelt, and fighting with rival raiders. One day, a stroke of mysterious luck thrust the Orc warrior to new heights of glory. Her raiding party ambushed a caravan transporting a scholar from Aravia, and overwhelmed the guards without trouble. When the cornered Elf begged for his life, he mentioned a weapon of great importance – the very thing that he had set out on his journey to find. Though not usually one to show mercy, Teela agreed to keep the scholar alive in exchange for everything he knew. This is how Teela learned of the Hexdrinker Scimitar, an ancient sword buried somewhere within the far northern reaches of the Deadlands, just north of the Thundermount. With such a powerful blade in her grasp, Teela could propel herself and her clan to greater heights. She insisted the Elven scholar accompany her party in their quest to find it.\r\n\r\nTrusting in the scholar's information, Teela led her raiders in a long march across sand dunes and dust mounds, their captive guiding them. Reading from an ancient map, the Elf led them to a burrow that predated even the Human raider clans that controlled the area. It had not been left unguarded, and Teela's attempt to breach it called scores of skeletal warriors to life. Teela and her Orcs fought tooth and nail against these Undead guardians, breaking them all apart before pushing deeper into the burrow. There, the head of the Undead host waited – a skeletal monster bearing the very shadow-cloaked blade Teela craved. The necromancer pulled a toothless, black-gummed grin, and the Orcs heard the crack and crunch of bone as the skeletons they had destroyed reformed behind them and marched toward their rear. Battle was renewed, and Teela knew she would have to kill the necromancer if she and her warriors were to survive. In the battle that followed, every Orc bar Teela was cut down, slashed and pierced with rusting blades and spears. The Elf too was slain.\r\n\r\nTeela herself barely survived. She ducked and dodged the necromancer's every swing and thrust of the Hexdrinker Scimitar, drenched with sweat, her brow furrowed and teeth bared in concentration and battle-anger. Her Undead foe assailed her with shadow magic as they fought, slowing and throwing off her movements. But with sheer determination, she won out. A slice to his neck saw the depraved sorcerer fall, and Teela caved in his face with her boot. Then she shattered his hand to wrest the Scimitar from him. The remaining skeletons clattered to the ground. The battle finally over, Teela then wept, for all around her lay the bodies of her loyal warriors. She found her alabaster white hair was splattered with their blood, and she refused to think of washing it out. She left the barrow, Scimitar in hand, wondering if the gain was worth the loss. Regardless of the truth then, she was determined to make it so her Orcs had not died in vain. The more enemies she slew with it, the more wealth she acquired using it, and the more necromancers she ended upon its point, she would ensure the sacrifice of her Orcs was a worthy one. They would all fall before the blade of Teela Goremane.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4260#static": "For the Dwarves who forged their ancient home in the depths of the Cloudspire Mountains, the name of their Skyiron Dominion came from the mysterious metal nuggets they found within the veins of iron and coal. Throbbing with a strange power, these early prospectors proclaimed these chunks to be the titular skyiron – heavenly minerals that had found a new home deep within the earth, not unlike the Dwarves who discovered them.\r\n\r\nFor eons, these chunks of otherworldly ore were revered by generations of blacksmiths like holy relics – objects so immutable that not even the Dwarven forges could unlock their potential. That was until Trunda Giltmallet made her attempt.\r\n\r\nTrunda longed to be the one to finally crack the secrets of skyiron. She had tried everything: hammers etched with primeval runescript, forges fueled by alchemical fire, and bathing the ore in the light of the moon. Nothing would melt skyiron. Even as Siroth’s Demonspawn battered at the doors of the Skyiron Dominion, Trunda labored. Even as her homeland collapsed, she did not falter.\r\n\r\nOne fateful night, a lone Demonspawn broke into Trunda's forge as she worked. Taking up a blade, she slashed at the beast, spraying its lifeblood over the forge. The Demonspawn's blood seared Trunda's skin with an infernal heat, hotter than anything she could stoke in the forge. Gasping with pain, she collected the boiling blood into her sturdiest crucible, dropping one of the skyiron chunks into the liquid. The blood foamed and spat, and the once seemingly indestructible skyiron melted.\r\n\r\nThe liquid turned a prismatic blue, unlike anything Trunda had ever seen. With unbridled enthusiasm, she forged a mighty hammer from this molten concoction of blood and metal. It glowed like starlight, with each swing of it unleashing a roar of the heavens, and searing its target with demonic heat. With this marriage of holy ore, unholy blood, and Dwarven smithing skill in her hands, Trunda fell upon the Demonspawn host with a righteous zeal, helping push Siroth's forces back into the mountain's depths. Thus began the legend of Trunda Giltmallet, wielder of the heavenly hammer, and master of the skyiron.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4270#static": "The Dwarves of Teleria are divided into two realms: Gloomdeep Hold, and the Skyiron Dominion. Both call themselves kingdoms, for both are ruled by kings. But that is where most of their similarities end.\r\n\r\nIn Gloomdeep Hold, the Mountain King has absolute power over his territory, both above ground and below it. He bears the weight of ultimate authority in his kingdom, and if disaster strikes his lands he will be held responsible for any harm his people suffer. It is not a weight one carries lightly, and the pressure can sometimes push the Mountain Kings of Gloomdeep to foolish action – it has already nearly cost the kingdom its royal line. In recent times, King Duran the Avaricious pressured his eldest son, Prince Gnut, to embark on a foolish adventure in the hopes that the boy would recover artifacts that could prove the glory of Gloomdeep Hold. It was a journey that would nearly cost the prince his life, all for the sake of competing with the Skyiron Dominion.\r\n\r\nThe Skyiron Dominion is ten times the size of Gloomdeep Hold, and is not one kingdom, but many. The Dominion is divided into cantons, which stretch both above and below the vales of the Cloudspire Mountains, and each has its own Skyiron Mountain King. A Mountain King's authority within their canton is strong, but far from absolute – they compete with guilds, nobles, militia captains, and others. Some groups have legal rights that the king cannot abridge, while others hold tremendous soft power and can compel the king to action or inaction. Then there is the political titan that is the Skyiron Navy. This and a few other institutions hold seats on the Grand Council of the Dominion, where matters affecting all Dwarves in the Cloudspire Mountains are discussed. If the Navy demand a tax of iron or soldiers, it is all but impossible for the kings to deny them. Some might see this as weakness, rulers bowing to the wishes of their officers. Those who say such things have likely never faced the wrath of a Skyiron warship. It is because of the Navy's strength that the Mountain Kings do not resent their shared strength, and they bear their titles with pride.\r\n\r\nHowever different the Skyiron Dominion and Gloomdeep Hold might be, they both trace their origins to the under-empire, a unified Dwarven realm that once stretched beneath the whole of Teleria. As a result, the armor and weapons of the Mountain Kings across the world are much the same. They speak the same oaths on their coronation, they carry similarly styled enchanted axes, and they wear identical crowns over their brows. In its heyday, the under-empire united every Dwarven holdfast in a vast network, some of which even wound beneath the seas. Most of the under-empire was lost long ago, but there are some who whisper that one of the lines of Mountain Kings reaches all the way back to the Dwarven Emperors of old. If this is true, it means that one king has the blood-right of absolute authority over all Dwarvenkind.\r\n\r\nFor now, these ideas remain only rumors. The kinship between the Dwarven realms has been so strong for so long, none have felt any need to unite them under a single banner. But relations between the cantons of the Skyiron Dominion and the cold fastness of Gloomdeep have strained in recent years, as the two are pulled apart by different alliances, different neighbors, and different beliefs. If the two Dwarven realms should someday turn on one another, those rumors of a potential Dwarven Emperor existing may rise up from the ashes of history to become a rallying cry. It may only be a matter of time before a power-hungry Mountain King seeks to reunite his people – not in brotherhood, but by the axe.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4380#static": "The warband that would become known as the Purifiers was founded by a young noblewoman of Kaerok, Lady Etessa. Her father, Lord Miguel Etessa, had been a leader of a mercenary force that achieved success fighting for various Banner Lords. Miguel was a dedicated servant of Lumaya, and his victories were many. He was ennobled as a knight of Kaerok, settled down, raised a family, and funded a shrine to Lumaya. \r\n\r\nHis daughter, Etessa, had too much of her father’s spirit to accept a life of privilege and peace. She used the family’s wealth to buy a fine crossbow, then put out a call for warriors who sought glorious adventure in Lumaya’s name. Miguel was troubled, but recalled his own younger days, and knew he could not deny Etessa's nature. He only made her promise that she would not fight for wealth, but to protect the common people and keep the Light of Lumaya.\r\n\r\nEtessa and her small band became roving adventurers who sought out and combatted the forces of Darkness throughout Kaerok. Accounts of monsters prowling the woods, of fell sorcerers demanding fealty from isolated villages, of unnaturally long-lived counts or of Demonspawn mounting incursions into settled lands all drew their attention. At times they also brought groups of mercenaries to heel, ending warbands that became too greedy or had turned to looting and crime between jobs.\r\n\r\nSuch days were carefree and easy for Etessa. She proved a natural leader, and while her disparate force of rogues were not all kind-hearted heroes of the people, she kept their activities honest and ensured they didn’t abuse their power. To those who wanted to receive payment for their actions, she gave coin out of her own personal wealth, though most were as ideologically committed to combating evil as she was.\r\n\r\nSlowly, that changed. As Etessa’s fame grew, more swore themselves to her, including less scrupulous volunteers. Factions started to form within the group, with some of the newcomers secretly claiming that Etessa was nothing but a spoiled noble's daughter, living out her violent fantasies. Even worse, many Banner Lords began to take notice. While Etessa had only ever acted for good, her force had grown to be the largest of its kind in the region, and having a rogue group of warriors roaming free within Kaerok’s borders was the last thing the nobility wanted.\r\n\r\nThe situation was a recipe for disaster. One Banner Lord, Sir Kerin, mustered a host and rode out to track Etessa down. Kerin’s force cornered Etessa’s, and Kerin demanded she surrender herself to answer for her vigilantism. As she stepped forth, however, a rider appeared among Sir Kerin’s forces. It proved to be none other than Deacon Armstrong, the firebrand preacher of the Sacred Order, renowned throughout Anhelt. Armstrong loudly declared that by decree of the Abbess, he had sought out Etessa and was offering both her and her warriors formal membership. From now on they would not be hardscrabble rogues, but warriors with holy purpose, answerable to the Order.\r\n\r\nThose in her war party with wavering loyalties or who had only ever been in it for the money abandoned Etessa. For her own part, she felt a renewed sense of purpose, a belief that now she truly was on a worthy path. It was from that point that her band were known as the Purifiers, famous for purging Anhelt of evil and undesirables. They have hounded the forces of Darkness relentlessly, and everything from petty criminals and runtling Skinwalkers, to vampires and Demonspawn, have learned to fear the news that Lady Etessa and her holy warriors have picked up their trail.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4420#static": "Siroth's demonic armies may be filled with reckless, slavering beasts, but his commanders are no fools. They marched on Teleria time and time again during the Age of Hellfire, their minds having been made immortal upon their creation centuries before. Every time one died at the hands of Teleria’s defenders, they were reborn in the black pits of Anathraad. All of Siroth's commanders were ferocious and bloodthirsty, but few were as cunning as the Duchess Lilitu.\r\n\r\nWhile she held great power, it was her wisdom that Lilitu’s followers respected most. Leading the Demonspawn invasion of the Dwarven under-empire, she knew her unruly legions would lose a straight battle against the disciplined Dwarven armies. Instead, she shrouded the Demonspawn with her dark magic, shielding them from Dwarven eyes. Even with their keen senses, the Dwarves could not detect Duchess Lilitu’s hordes as she led them through the tunnels. When the Duchess knew the time was right, she bade her armies strike. They shattered much of the under-empire, with only Gloomdeep Hold and the Skyiron Dominion managing to cling on against the demonic assault. The Dwarves lost the war before it had even begun.\r\n\r\nAfter every victory – and there were many – Lilitu returned to Anathraad to declare Siroth's success, and her loyalty to his cause. It was then that she would learn of defeats across Teleria, at the hands of the Arbiter and her forces. Every defeat shattered Duchess Lilitu’s sense of success. For centuries, she has harbored a deep hatred for the Arbiter that rivals even Siroth's. It is the Arbiter that robs her of Siroth's pride, and it is the Arbiter who Duchess Lilitu has pledged to destroy.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4430#static": "Thea is a Lightbringer who returned to Teleria from the Halls of Eternity to fight against Siroth's forces before the Second Great War. Her tale is not a happy one, she is a broken shadow of her former, glorious self.\r\n\r\nIn her time of greatness, Thea was a warrior with golden angelic wings, glittering hair, and platinum armor who sought out evil wherever it could be found. Thea fought endlessly against Demonspawn, Undead, and any who threatened Teleria with war and death, becoming a beacon of hope for the Sacred Order in every battle. Soldiers claimed to see an angel watching over them from high above when she soared over the field, and she became known as Thea the Dauntless. She was honorable beyond repute and her integrity was unimpeachable. But even her example could not prevent the Sacred Order from falling into corruption and unleashing cruelty. The Red Crusade, during which the Order set about purging all Anhelt of Skinwalkers, and in the process slaughtered countless Orcs, Lizardmen, and Ogryn, was a turning point. Thea had joined the Arbiter's cause to defeat Siroth, not to hunt down and butcher the innocent. She left the Order and wandered Teleria alone, a dangerous thing in an increasingly broken world.\r\n\r\nWithout duty or purpose, Thea grew weaker as the years went by. Her heartbreak at the state of the world was a poison in her veins, and it sapped her strength. Her glittering hair grew dull, she found her plate too heavy to bear, and her wings withered. When the Knights Revenant came for her, she was too frail to stop them. They surrounded her, catching her completely unawares in a dark forest Thea could not name, in the shadow of a mountain she did not recognize. With a single maul-strike, a Knight knocked her unconscious.\r\n\r\nThey strapped Thea to a wooden table in a dark, windowless cell. Blood and filth coated the walls and floor. Only when she awoke did they pluck the feathers from her wings, reducing them to nothing more than bone and sinew. Every day, sorcerers came to her, slicing some part of her flesh for whatever insane experiments they were conducting, or even for food. Some stood over her, held her head, and muttered dark incantations. Thea’s screams and cries echoed from her cell sometimes for hours at a time.\r\n\r\nFor years, Thea suffered at the hands of the Knights Revenant, who grew complacent, and greedy. They no longer wanted her as a test subject. They wanted to use her as a weapon, and developed a ritual that would enslave her soul to them. Careful that they did not kill her outright – and that her bindings were still secure – the Knights Revenant sawed off the remains of her wings, the first element of the ritual providing vital components for the last. The Knights then stood in a circle around Thea and cast their spell, and she was consumed by green flames. Her screams could be heard even over the fire’s roaring. Only after an hour did the Knights stop. The flames petered out. Smoke rose from Thea’s body. She was unconscious but still breathing.\r\n\r\nThe Knights thought they had succeeded. They made small requests and asked questions of her, which she obediently fulfilled and truthfully answered. But Thea was merely playing the game. Her tormentors removed her restraints, and learned how wrong they were. Thea’s love for Lumaya, her loyalty to the Arbiter, her sense of duty and purpose – all were far too strong for the spell to take true effect. She rose from the table, and butchered her torturers in seconds, tearing them limb from limb with her bare hands. Surrounded by tools, and weapons, she magically welded them into new, malign-looking armor, and a new set of wings bound to her by magic alone, and stepped over the corpses and out into the rest of the Knights’ sanctuary, determined to kill all she found.\r\n\r\nWhen Thea left her prison with hundreds of dead cultists in her wake, the Arbiter was waiting for her, and tried to embrace her. Thea rejected the gesture, and spat on the floor. The Arbiter had abandoned her, she said, and could not expect loyalty or gratitude from her. She made it clear that the forces of evil would come to fear her as they once did, but never again would she fight beside armies claiming to be forces of ‘Light’ or ‘goodness’. She would stalk the tombs, catacombs, and temples of Darkness – and purge the horrors within – alone.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4460#static": "The Banner Lords of Kaerok know their history, for ancestral lineage and the deeds of one’s forefathers are a large source of a lord’s power and prestige. This may be why Staltus has looked so deeply into his history, finding past injustices and lingering questions that have led him to his crusade as Dragonbane. \r\n\r\nStaltus makes no secret of the fact that he has never slain a Dragon, nor even encountered one. But for him this is precisely the point: the age of Dragons has passed, and to the benefit of all other species of Teleria. As Dragonbane, his quest is the remembrance of Dragons, their spawn, their empires… and their sins. The truth of Dragons lies in the distant past, and Staltus wishes the world to remember the truths of their bygone civilization and never repeat its mistakes. He travels Teleria in search of their relics which he stores securely in the vaults of his estate, and when he hears a rumor of a Dragon lingering on in some forgotten corner of Teleria, he turns that corner over.\r\n\r\nStaltus will tell anyone who will listen how the lore of Dragons begins in the mythopoetic Primordial Age, and how they were among the Firstborn of Lumaya and Siroth – immortal and powerful beyond comprehension. Created later were the Dragonkin – like Dragons but smaller, frailer, mortal, and changeable, and imbued with the Light of Lumaya, inheriting a zealous love of order and hierarchy. Staltus knows the failures of both well. During the gods' Great Divorce, the Firstborn Dragons sided with Siroth. As for the Dragonkin, they grew a compulsion to protect, arrange, and control every aspect of Telerian existence, from the placement of buildings and towns to the comings and goings of citizens and livestock. Their firm and gentle authority slowly gave way to tyranny and oppression, and Staltus has seen firsthand the legacy of despotism the Dragonkin Empire left behind.\r\n\r\nTelerians know that Dragonkin colonies once existed in Anhelt and Peltas, and in parts of cities such as Arnoc and Velyzar ancient artifacts and forgotten caches can still be found. Bribing officials and hiring disposable lackeys, Staltus has interrogated these townships and recorded findings of strange machines half-buried and half-smashed, of sinister technologies of torture, and of fragments of primordial magics the likes of which have not manifested for generations. He and his hired help braved the dust storms and wandering Undead of the blighted Stormwind Wastes, searching until they came across a great rift in the ground. It is said that therein Staltus discovered something that cost the lives of the rest of his companions. \r\n\r\nThough he has made it his mission to preserve the knowledge of the ancient Dragonkin Empire, Staltus has never put to word nor page the secret things he witnessed in the Wastes. He speaks elliptically of ‘the Sin of Dragons,’ of the banishment of the gods from Teleria and the fall of the Dragonkin Empire. But all saw that whatever it was he discovered there, it had invigorated his cause, for it was at this point that Staltus’ obsession with Dragons became a towering, self-righteous hatred. \r\n\r\nBut the crimes that cause such anger in Staltus were in the distant past, and even the Dragonkin – or rather their Lizardmen descendants – have lamented their transgressions and made great work of repentance. Ever since the hubris of a single emperor brought about the downfall of their entire species, they have suffered much and worked for generations toward a new identity and some dignity in the eyes of an unforgiving world. \r\n\r\nRegardless, Staltus rarely separates the Dragonkin and their descendants today. He has hacked the life from many with his ax, and has lined his plate and helm with their scales and horn. Like all fanatics, his proximity to his obsession means Staltus has absorbed some of its aspects, and some say that the archaic wisdom of the Dragonkin has aided Staltus in his travels and studies. Though he despises them, he has no compunctions against using their knowledge practically, with ritual invocations that call forth different aspects of a Dragon’s power. And so it is that in battle, the Dragonbane sometimes resembles that which he hates most.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4490#static": "The Stag Knight’s origins lie during the rule of King Guarin of Kaerok. This near-mythical figure was originally King Guarin’s younger brother, Forthwin, who grew up with all the privileges of his station and fully enjoyed them. He jousted, feasted, and gambled, but most of all he loved to hunt with his rich young companions. At his coming of age tournament, he skewered a great white hart, and during the celebrations adopted it as part of his heraldry, as well as adding the ends of its antlers to his helm. From that day onward he was known as the Stag Knight.\r\n\r\nForthwin could not have guessed then that his days of excess were drawing to a close. Guarin’s rule was brutal and repressive, and the people of Kaerok, as well as some of the nobility, were contemplating resistance. When Guarin ordered a new tax be raised to pay for his next birthday feast, there was an uprising, one which included Guarin’s own uncle, Norchard.\r\n\r\nDespite knowing little of the hardships of life beyond the court or the cruelty of his older brother, Forthwin took up his sword to defend the crown. He fought well against the rebels, leading his cohort of knights to victory on the right flank of Guarin’s host at the Battle of Felwich. The rebellion collapsed, and Forthwin successfully hunted down Norchard and dozens of his followers and brought them to his brother's capital.\r\n\r\nGuarin had declared that those surviving rebels who surrendered would receive clemency. However, when any prisoners were brought before him, he refused to pardon them. He ordered not only their execution, but their torture beforehand, drawing out the agonies of several hundred captives over a period of weeks.\r\n\r\nForthwin, who had not truly appreciated his older brother’s nature, was sickened by the excessive violence. Eventually only one rebel, Norchard, remained. By Guarin’s decree, all of the nobility were forced to attend his execution, lest they be added to the death-tally. Unable to restrain himself any longer, Forthwin pleaded for Norchard publicly. Surely Guarin had killed enough?\r\n\r\nForthwin had misjudged his brother one last time. Rather than relent, or even pause, Guarin flew into a rage. The Stag Knight was cast into the dungeons, where he began to appreciate just how badly he had wasted his youth in frivolous pursuits while the kingdom had suffered under his brother’s rule. He prayed to Lumaya for forgiveness for how blind he had been, and prepared to meet his fate.\r\n\r\nThat night, Forthwin awoke not to the rough grasp of the jailer, but to an unearthly presence. An armored woman, stern-featured and radiating with brilliant luminescence, had appeared in his cell. She claimed she was the Arbiter, the legendary, divine lieutenant of Lumaya herself. She had observed Forthwin, and understood his genuine desire to make amends for the sins of his brother, as well as his own past excesses.\r\n\r\nForthwin fell to his knees and made an oath to do the will of Lumaya. The Arbiter temporarily blinded the dungeon guards with her brilliance, and helped the Stag Knight to escape and retrieve his wargear. He then when to Guarin’s chambers and entered, none moving to stop him, for the glory of Lumaya was upon him. What words passed between the two brothers are unknown, but at the end of their meeting the king lay slain.\r\n\r\nThe Stag Knight rode away as dawn broke, spurning his inheritance and even his name. He passed over into legend, a warrior of righteous vengeance who some believe continues to watch over Kaerok, and will intercede in Lumaya’s name if ever again a corrupt king again rises and claims the throne.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4510#static": "Whether they live in Frostheim, among the Redspike Mountains, or travel the dunes of the Krokhan Desert, the name of Wurlim Frostking is a curse among the descendants of the Old Norr. That might seem strange at first, for those who know their history know that Wurlim was once the greatest leader of the Old Norr, the Lord of Winter, a mighty warlord of towering stature, strong arm, and rapacious intent. Still, his name will always be associated with his people’s fall from grace.\r\n\r\nDuring the First Great War, the Old Norr enjoyed an unrivaled period of power and prosperity. With the armies of Lumaya and Siroth locked in a conflict that would decide the fate of Teleria, neither side had the resources required to counter the raiding expeditions launched by the Old Norr from their icy northern fjords in the Winterlands. While they had made pacts with Lumaya long before, these pillagers showed little compunction about attacking her servants when they were near-defenseless. Under Wurlim’s direction, the Old Norr grew strong, looting coastlines from Aravia to the Sorrowlakes and venturing as far as the Lost Isles to the south.\r\n\r\nSuch successes could not continue forever. Realizing that attacks by Wurlim were undermining the war effort, the Arbiter visited the Frostking’s icy halls and demanded that the Old Norr cease their attacks on the followers of Lumaya. She reminded Wurlim that his people had once sworn to follow the Goddess of Light, and that she now had need of them. Not only were the Old Norr to restrain their raiding, but they were also to serve the Arbiter in a campaign she had planned, one that would take them to the pinnacle of the world.\r\n\r\nWhile many Old Norr railed at such presumptuousness, Wurlim sensed possibility in the Arbiter’s commands. She wished to turn them into something more than just raiders, to forge them into a unified people, of which he would be king. It might only be to meet her own short-term ends, but the result would still be the same – the Old Norr would be more united and battle-hardened than they had ever been, and it would be Wurlim who led them.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Frostking agreed to aid the Arbiter, and summoned Old Norr and Jotunn tribes to attend him. With the greatest gathering of warriors ever seen in the north, Wurlim set out, following the Arbiter on her secret quest.\r\n\r\nAfter many weeks of marching, they arrived at their destination, a warm, still lake at the very capstone of Teleria, somehow existing unfrozen in the icy landscape. There too they found a Demonspawn army. Wurlim assumed the army's destruction was the Arbiter’s objective, and he led the Old Norr into the fray, confident of victory.\r\n\r\nBut his confidence proved fatal, for close to the lake was a portal into Anathraad. Demonic reinforcements poured through, overwhelming the Old Norr and the Jotunn. Wurlim demanded the Arbiter’s assistance, but she was chanting arcane spells over the lake’s edge. Too late, Wurlim realized that they had been tricked. The Arbiter cared nothing for the Old Norr and the Jotunn, he thought. She simply wished to use them to distract the Demonspawn while she attempted to close the portal.\r\n\r\nWurlim sought to reach and slay her, but before he could the Arbiter finished her incantation. Ice from the surrounding mountains swept into the lake as the waters themselves froze, forming a great glacier. Wurlim and his surviving warriors were caught in the spell’s effects, frozen solid and sealed away as assuredly as the portal.\r\n\r\nWith the Old Norr’s leadership in disarray, the Arbiter seized her opportunity to forever end their unruliness and unpredictability, scattering the rest of the tribes and causing the great migration of the Old Norr peoples from the Winterlands. Many believe that Wurlim’s foolish pride was the reason they were cast out of the north, and assume him to be long dead or, at the very least, still entombed in his icy grave. Such assumptions are incorrect.\r\n\r\nAges after he was trapped, Wurlim’s body was freed and resurrected by the corrupt necromantic scholar Bad-el-Kazar, the Grandmaster of Ireth. Ireth had long had a pact with the infamous Cult of K’Leth but, knowing of the duplicitousness of the Knights Revenant, he intended to attain both a new bodyguard and a bargaining chip. Wurlim could certainly act as both, for the hulking, icy brute was more than a match for even the most experienced Knights Revenant. Wurlim oversaw Ireth’s dealings with the Knights Revenant before the grandmaster eventually sold him into the cult’s ranks. Now, as Wurlim broods on the changed world before him, it seems unlikely the old Lord of Winter will be content to live as their pawn.",

Nestled within the backstreets of Port Wretched, people from all corners of Teleria have found comfort inside this establishment. With its fine food, roaring fires, and flowing ale, even the bloodiest feuds can melt away upon entering. And who is the proprietress of this beloved watering hole? That would be none other than Maulie Tankard, who can talk the wings off a dragon, sell ice to the Jotunn, and could probably convince Siroth himself to quit his schemes, if she ever wanted him in her tavern. Matriarch of the Stout Oak Inn for years, Maulie has served everyone, from curious kings to the lowest deckhands. While devoted to her inn, Maulie also occasionally hosts her famous banquets back home in Gloomdeep Hold – only on special request.\r\n\r\nAs a landlady in one of the roughest ports in Teleria, Maulie Tankard is no stranger to violence. From bar brawls and riots, to murders and back-alley ambushes, she has no qualms with intervening to protect her establishment. The stories about her have become the stuff of legend. Some swear – between healthy draughts of Maulie’s finest ale – that she once held off a screaming host of Undead from wrecking her tavern, armed with nothing more than a roasting fork. Others say that she defeated an entire clan of Orcs in a series of arm wrestling contests while still rustling up her famous soup of the day. Ask Maulie about any of these tales, and she will spin an even greater yarn, complete with additional anecdotes that will have even the most serious clients rolling with laughter.\r\n\r\nThere are days when Maulie dreams of packing her belongings and traveling the world, so she can finally indulge her wanderlust – caused by years of listening to her patrons' wild stories. Above all, however, she still loves her job. So while there are drinks to be poured, fights to break up, and vomit to be mopped up, you will find Maulie behind the bar of the Stout Oak Inn, ready to delight customers with a foaming pint, a succulent meat pie, and a story about a drunk patron she had served the night before.",

The Sacred Order peddles death, but it is an immutable fact that those who live by the sword will often die by it. And so the Sacred Order must always grow, lest it bleed itself dry before it can kill all of its enemies.\r\n\r\nMany join the Sacred Order willingly, entering its territorial realm, the Lands of Rebirth, to cast off their old names and old sins, becoming someone new in exchange for ten years of service. But volunteers alone are not enough to keep the ranks full. Sacred Order recruiters regularly march out of the Lands of Rebirth to Kaerok, Frostheim, and the Free Cities, and while they try to find the best and brightest in all of Teleria, in hard times they will take anyone. When they found Shamael as a young child, however, they were anything but disappointed.\r\n\r\nMany people of Anhelt assume that the bizarre tests the Sacred Order recruiters employ are entirely contrived. Onlookers have no idea whether or not words or actions of the young children examined are 'good' or otherwise, and the Order always seems to take who it wants. On occasion, multiple children have even responded entirely differently to the same test, and yet all have been taken regardless. But those tests must measure something real, because when a group of Sacred Order knights tested Shamael, they were visibly shocked and thrilled. They demanded that he depart with them immediately. His mother resisted – if she were to let Shamael be taken, she might never see him again. Her resistance was useless. Shamael was pulled from her arms, and the soldiers left her weeping behind them, begging them to show mercy.\r\n\r\nShamael was too young to remember much of what that felt like – to be kidnapped, have one future ripped away, and another forced upon him. He was encouraged to forget. His memories of home faded quickly, and before long they lingered only in his subconscious and his dreams. As he grew older, he held a private longing for a woman he could not quite recall – a woman with tear-filled eyes, but whose face was only a blur. But he did not have much time to devote to these thoughts.\r\n\r\nShamael’s life became one of relentless physical training, rigorous study, and unfailing religious devotion, and his potential lived up to the promises of his early testing. He was a quick study in both the martial and the scholastic arts and he amazed his tutors in every field. His excellence alienated him from his peers, leaving his station atop his class a lonely one – until the day he met Athel.",

Tales of headless horsemen, beasts under the bed, things that go bump in the night – for every genuine account of a horrifying creature, there is a frightening story meant to delight children on a stormy autumn night. While most of these monsters stay safely in the world of the imaginary, there is one in particular that inhabits both the dream and the real. All must beware of the wrath of Harvest Jack, who cackles his way across the fields of Kaerok with scythe in hand.\r\n\r\nHarvest Jack’s story began as a happy one – one of a mischievous spirit who inhabited the carved vegetable lanterns of Lozrayn, Kaerok's annual harvest festival. He played harmless pranks, possessed nearby scarecrows to make them dance, and sang for the delight of all who saw him. Jack was also a cunning trickster, often challenging local farmers to games of riddles. If someone solved one of Jack's puzzles, he would bless them with a bountiful harvest for the next year. If they failed at his game, he would give his playmate a scare, but all in good jest. For many generations, the appearance of this jolly apparition was cause for great celebration, signaling the start of the harvest, and much revelry among the people of Kaerok.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Siroth's darkness encroached further into Teleria and the War of Kaerok saw its once peaceful fields watered with blood, Jack's playful spirit became twisted with malice and hate. His pranks grew more and more vicious, and his good-hearted scares became truly terrifying. During one fateful celebration, Jack's usual merry dance became a waltz of blood, with him taking up a scythe and cutting down his audience as if they were wheat ready for reaping. Possessing the festival's most prized pumpkin, Jack transformed it, carving into it the blood-chilling grimace that now so terrorizes the farmfolk of Kaerok each autumn. During that season, farmers listen in fear for the sound of Jack's ear-splitting cackle – the signal that his dreadful harvest has begun.\r\n\r\nNo longer do people in Kaerok leave pumpkins and turnips sitting outside their homes at harvest time as they once did, waiting for a once playful apparition to make his appearance. No longer does that harmlessly rebellious sprite feature in the ghost stories told to children around campfires. Now, all that remains are the chilling tales of Harvest Jack, and countless souls fear that to speak his name is to invite his wrath.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4570#static": "From a young age, the girl who would become known as Madame Serris was drawn to the forbidden arts; not just shadow magic, but all of the dangerous magic forbidden by the rulers of Aravia. With an aptitude for the arcane which far outstripped that of her peers, Serris was considered to be one of Aravia’s most gifted students of magic. But though her education rivaled that of even senior mages of Ireth, it was not enough for the young sorceress. She wanted – needed – to know more.\r\n\r\nSerris hungered for proscribed knowledge in a way that many of her peers found unsettling, could find no one willing to teach her, and was the subject of much suspicion for it. She desired to feel the touch of powers she could only dream about. It was in her dreams that the answer came. \r\n\r\nThe Dreamwalker visited Serris, and whispered to her of sorceries such as she had never imagined. He also showed her how to contact those who might teach her that which she desired to know. She first learned shadow magic from the sorcerers among them. But even that satisfied her for only a short time. There was more to be learned, she was certain of it.\r\n\r\nSerris was forced to resort to more unpleasant methods, including necromancy, to get what she wanted. She was caught plundering the burial vaults of one of Aravia’s noblest families, and banished. She joined other Elvish exiles in Durham Forest, but had little interest in the new society that was being formed there, or in the conflict brewing in Aravia. She instead retreated to an isolated village to continue her studies uninterrupted. This she did for a number of years, and during this time learned how to extend her own life through the consumption of an alchemical concoction of her own devising, brewed from the bones of the dead blended with crushed chronogrubs and droplets of her own blood. It turned her flesh green and her eyes amber.\r\n\r\nBut once again Serris' methods attracted the wrong sort of attention and she was forced to flee yet deeper into the forest. There, she discovered an ancient ruin, a stone tower, broken by time and overgrown with moss. Within, she found colonies of mourn-bats. Serris found that her necromantic studies had given her an affinity for the blood-sucking creatures, and that she could communicate with them to some degree.\r\n\r\nDeciding it was an omen, Serris made her home in the ruin, and made it over into a place fit for contemplation and study. Moreover, she layered a shroud of magical wards and spells of misdirection over the area, ensuring that it could only be found if she allowed it. No more would she be forced to depart in haste, halting her studies. The mourn-bats became her eyes and ears in the forest, and nothing they observed escaped her notice. \r\n\r\nIn the years since, Serris has rarely ventured into the more civilized regions of the forest, and then only because some Dark Elf lordling has learned of her and requested her aid. Serris will only agree to these requests if her price is met. Her demands are largely innocuous… a certain book, a consignment of unique herbs, a few slaves. Other times, it is something more enigmatic… the skull of a noted scholar, for instance, or a mystical artifact. In all cases, her clients know better than to ask why she wants such things. Some things are better left unknown.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4580#static": "Long ago, in the mage city of Ireth, a talented young sorcerer named Alvano sought to unravel a mystery that had long mesmerized scholars and wizards alike – the enigma of creation itself. For all their efforts, no mortal could replicate the creation of the souls that animates living beings. Souls could be manipulated, preserved, and bound to a body in the limbo of Undeath, but never brought out of nothing.\r\n\r\nAlvano had been orphaned before reaching his teenage years, and longed to find the means to defeat death, and bring his parents – truly – back to life, as they had been when he was a child. He was obsessed to the point that no one or thing could distract him. No method, idea, or experiment was too much. All there was was the goal.\r\n\r\nAlvano spent weeks at a time in morgues and cemeteries, experimenting on the recently deceased. When not in such places he pored over dusty tomes or plundered barrows in search of magic-rich artifacts that might give him the power he sought. He knew he needed colossal volumes of energy, for only the gods had ever created before, beings of immeasurable power. The lightning storms that lashed Ireth’s towers were one source, but they were not enough. He needed to magnify that energy a thousandfold, and his magical talents alone were insufficient for that. The answer was the Prazinon, a large viridian gemstone, said to have been first mined by the Dwarves of the Skyiron Dominion and engraved with miniscule runes to power great engines in their hold. A road of blood and lies finally brought the smooth hexagonal crystal into Alvano’s hands. He cried when he held it. It was the final piece he needed. Everything else was ready for his first ritual, that would surely prove his theories correct.\r\n\r\nAtop Alvano's tower on the outskirts of Ireth, strapped to a gurney lay a humanoid figure, made from flesh of several corpses stitched together, the Prazinon embedded in its chest. It was linked by long cables to a tall lightning rod that rose above the tower’s point. As a storm rolled over the city, Alvano stood next to the figure, chanting passages from ancient grimoires, stirring up more and more lightning and guiding it to the rod. The Prazinon glowed brightly, its heat so fierce that rain striking it hissed to nothing on impact.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour, with a howl of pain and misery, the conglomeration of flesh and magic lurched into life, and snapped the chains meant to hold it in place. His experiment successful, Alvano fell to his knees with his hands aloft in triumph. Despite all the challenges, he had achieved the impossible. Alvano imagined himself before his fellow mages at Ireth, basking in their praise.\r\n\r\nThis moment did not last for long. Confused, angry, and shocked, the monster thrashed around wildly. In these throes of madness it yanked on the cables implanted into its flesh and pulled the lightning rod down. It landed on Alvano’s head, killing him instantly. The creature picked up the rod and lurched into the tower, later emerging on the streets. Later, bloody footprints were identified, and some locals reported hearing howls of grief, even remorse, in the night.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath, various magi investigated Alvano’s tower. They learned what he had tried to accomplish, and guessed at what he had created. They sent out hunters looking for it, and none returned. To this day no one knows what happened to Alvano's ‘Miscreated Monster’, but many continue to build on his dark work…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4590#static": "One of the most persistent misconceptions about Skinwalkers is that they transform back and forth, sometimes appearing in Human form to live among Human communities and only assuming the appearance of a hybrid beast under certain conditions. One archetypal myth says that a Skinwalker will be compelled to shift with the rise of a full moon. Other legends describe totems or rituals that can change them back and forth. Historically, many people of Frostheim revered beast-shifters as divinely blessed, and called them forth for war. These Berserkers were said to don enchanted cloaks to transform into bears, wolves, and other beasts. Brakus, a young lad in the Kingdom of Frostheim, grew up enamored with these tales.\r\n\r\nA few elements of the Lumayan Church that operate in Frostheim still take a more accepting stance on Skinwalkers, due to this history. Their remote lodges are where Brakus went first to slake his burning curiosity about the Berserkers of old. But he was told that the age of Berserkers was past, and the archaic rituals used to engender their unique powers were no longer practiced, most knowledge of their detail lost in the Red Crusade. The priests encouraged him to live by the example of his heroes of old, but not in such a literal way. And they firmly told him to trifle not with Skinwalkers. The faith may respect them, and hope to guide them on the right path, but each and every one of them was nonetheless a grave potential danger, and that is something Frostheimers and even the Norr of old would agree on.\r\n\r\nBrakus refused to accept this answer. He was absolutely convinced the Berserkers of old were true shifters who retained their noble souls, and equally convinced that their glory days could come again in the present age. Abandoning theology, he turned to other sources of knowledge. Folklore and rumors, ancient ballads and cycles of legends, crumbling texts and the mutterings of decrepit elders – no source was too obscure or incredible for Brakus to pursue. Abandoning all else, he traveled all over Anhelt chasing one lead after another until, at last, he located a Dark Elf hermit in the depths of Durham Forest who claimed to be the keeper of an ancient spirit-wolf. The hermit, Khadarak, told Brakus that the creature had been his familiar, but now had gone rampant and could not be tamed or calmed again. Khadarak claimed that the wolf was descended from the very wolves the Old Norr created Berserkers from, bearing a still-pure magical bloodline. He asked Brakus to kill the spirit-wolf, and this, he assured the headstrong Frostheimer, would make Brakus like unto a pure and noble shifter of auld.\r\n\r\nBrakus did not hesitate a moment, but girded himself and set forth to find his prey. Thinking himself guided by destiny to bring new honor and glory to his ancestors, he used the keen senses and instincts that a lifetime of searching had built up in him and soon found the creature’s den. He struck in the light of a full moon, and took the massive and strangely lambent creature by surprise, and though it fought back, it did not recover from Brakus’ first savage blow. Brakus stood over the bloodied form of the shining spirit-wolf, and with one killing stroke of his ax, his dream began to come true. But, in ways that he had never anticipated, it became a struggle and a nightmare. \r\n\r\nAs the hermit had promised, the wolf triggered the Skinwalker curse in Brakus, as if it had been born and bred for it. But if that wolf’s revenant spirit was meant to be somehow pure, it was yet impure enough to overwhelm that of the naïve, young Brakus. He had expected a shower of glory, instead his soul was assaulted and he was challenged to an inner battle more intense by far than any his body had ever known. That wolf had centuries of hunger in its cursed being, and Brakus felt his every memory and aspect being torn apart as if by a thousand jaws. Brakus the Shifter was born, and a cruel affront to Teleria created, a tragic beast that was the exception to prove a Skinwalker rule.\r\n\r\nBrakus does shift, for the briefest of moments, on nights that are thick with cloud or storm-wracked. Naked, cold, afraid, he feels his humanity reform for just a moment, and curses his old self, his hubris, for just long enough to remember his endless misery. Then once more the wolves of madness are upon him, and this brief moment of weakness ends, and Brakus the Shifter becomes once again a beast of terror and legendary violence.",

Had he chosen to embrace his legacy of violence, the path that awaited him would have been a very different one indeed.\r\n\r\nGalek’s father, Artak, was an Orc warlord of vicious temperament. The son of the chieftain Turan, he had witnessed first-hand the treachery of those who wished nothing but death and destruction on his people. Turan had sought to deal with the Humans of the Kingdom of Kaerok, leading the warriors of his clan to battle for one of the Banner Lords against his rival, in exchange for a place within his territory they could settle in peacefully once their service was complete. But the Human noble betrayed Turan, and the persecution continued.\r\n\r\nDisgusted by such treachery as well as his father’s perceived weakness, Artak retaliated. He rallied the Orc clans and led them on a campaign that ravaged parts of Kaerok. Galek, Artak’s only child, fought at his father’s side and led the attack on the Free City of Delanos, capturing the gatehouse and allowing Artak and his warriors to storm the city. In the aftermath, Artak tested Galek by ordering him to execute a captured Human family. Galek hesitated but, fired by his father’s recital of all the wrongs his people had suffered and reminded that they had to do whatever it took to survive, he struck the fatal blows.\r\n\r\nSuch brutality may have repaid old injustices, but it inevitably spawned fresh ones. Outrage over the massacre at Delanos caused the forces of Kaerok to rally. They engaged the Orc host in a great battle at Nearhaven where the Orcs were driven back, retreating into Nearhaven's castle, which they had earlier captured. During the fighting Artak himself was seized. Galek could only look on from Nearhaven’s ramparts as his father was brought forth and beheaded by the vengeful Humans.\r\n\r\nKnowing that they would not survive a siege, a number of the remaining senior members of the clan convinced Galek to lead a breakout that night. They also pointed out that it was unlikely the clan’s noncombatants would make it out. Knowing they would slow the retreat, Galek begrudgingly agreed to leave them behind. As darkness fell, the surviving clan warriors hacked their way free. As they made their escape Nearhaven was stormed, the fires of its destruction lighting the night sky, and the wailing of those abandoned haunting those still able to escape.\r\n\r\nAfter that desperate day, Galek and his hardened band of survivors stalked Kaerok, acting as guerrillas who raided and harried the Banner Lords and the Free Cities from areas of dense woodland, marshes, or wastes. Galek’s sacrifices had hardened and embittered him, and left no survivors in his attacks. Whenever his judgment was questioned he reminded his remaining kin of his father’s words – these lands would be reclaimed, whatever it took.\r\n\r\nGalek hoped that his ongoing resistance would draw more Orcs to his banner, and slowly he would be able to rebuild his strength until he was in a position to strike properly at Kaerok once more. When that time came, he swore he would show no hesitation, and no mercy. As far as Galek was concerned, only the extermination of the Banner Lords could guarantee his people’s peace, though in truth it seemed Galek had forgotten the very meaning of the word. He was a warlord in every sense, and his only ambition was to succeed where his father and grandfather both failed.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4630#static": "Many stories in Dwarven folklore tell of a mysterious figure who is able to command winter itself. Clad in frost-encrusted armor, this Dwarf is said to wield a hammer of such chilling power that one touch can freeze even the raging torrents of molten metal that swirl within the forges of Gloomdeep Hold. Legends have given this warrior many names over the ages – the Ghost of the Forge, the Frozen Hammer, and the Winter Phantom among them. While lore keepers debate who this being is or whether they exist at all, some believe the tales are all of one Dwarf – a tragic figure known as Tormin the Cold.\r\n\r\nAll of these tales share the same beginning: they tell of Tormin, the son of a humble blacksmith in Gloomdeep Hold, who grew up longing to learn his father’s trade. But no matter how much he tried to love smithing, Tormin could never tolerate the forge’s torridity. His reaction was physical, every time he approached his father’s furnace, the heat made him gag and vomit. Tormin’s only respite came from standing near a small shaft, through which a frigid wind blew from the frozen north.\r\n\r\nThis icy air quelled Tormin’s pain, but he could not conquer his reaction to the abominable heat of the forge. One day, after yet another failed visit to his father’s smithy, Tormin could no longer stand it. Hopeless and ashamed, he left his home and went to seek solace in the north. Soon Tormin found himself lost among the crags and tunnels of the Mountains of Despair, where he remained for many years.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Tormin eventually escaped the mountains’ vast tunnels, leaving on a boat from Port Wretched. No one knows for how long he sailed, but all the stories agree that Tormin’s travels took him to an enormous glacier, somewhere in the Winterlands of the far north. No one knows what went through Tormin’s heart when he lay his hands on the ice. Perhaps the sight of it, its surface as smooth as blown glass, seemed to Tormin to be a cold mirror of the molten metals in his father’s forge. When he lay his hands upon the glacier, its chilly spirit took hold of him, wrapping his being in its infinite ice. The enchantment took hold of every part of Tormin, even spreading to the forge hammer that he kept with him. The frost cut to Tormin's very bones but for the first time, he felt at peace. \r\n\r\nHis body now wreathed in frost, Tormin made the long journey back to Gloomdeep Hold, the home he had abandoned out of deep shame. There, he approached the furnace that had been the source of such humiliation in his youth. With great trepidation, Tormin drew closer to the roiling fire. No sickness swelled in his chest, no dizziness gripped him. He was no longer repulsed by the forge’s searing heat – the glacier's touch allowed him to finally tolerate the scalding air that swirled around him. Joy filled Tormin's heart and so, he set about forging himself a suit of magic armor that he longed to make as a boy. Tormin worked long into the night, using his frozen hammer to craft breastplates and gauntlets that could withstand attacks from both natural and unnatural foes. It is said that when the armor was finished, and with his desire to engage in his father’s trade fulfilled, Tormin vanished to travel north once more. He supposedly left nothing in the forge but a rime-covered anvil and a wisp of freezing fog.\r\n\r\nTo this day, Tormin’s whereabouts remain a mystery. While many see him solely as a figure of myth, some Dwarven smiths claim that from time to time they feel an unnatural presence while working in their forges. They hear the echo of a hammer on ice, resonating from deep within the earth, followed by the sensation of a freezing breeze.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4640#static": "Durham Forest is a vast sprawl of woodland harboring more than just deep, creeping darkness. A traveler foolish enough to wander into its depths might be enslaved or murdered by the cutthroat Dark Elves, or preyed upon by any number of vicious monstrosities, from writhing nests of carno-grubs to the packs of snap-jaw forest wolves, or flocks of blood-sucking blackwing bats that make their nests in the dense canopy. Nor can the forest’s flora be ignored, for there is little in Durham that isn’t inimical to life, be it razor-leaf flowers or strangling vines.\r\n\r\nDurham is a dark and deadly place, so it is with great surprise to a small number of travelers that they have stumbled across a space in the forest that, on first glance, is neither of those things. According to the few who have made it out alive, there is a clearing somewhere within Durham where the light of the sun dares make its presence known, shining down upon a humble hut of timber and moss thatch. Its quiet, peaceful nature seems utterly out of step with the nightmares of the eves surrounding it.\r\n\r\nThe occupant of the hut is just as expectation-defying. He is an Ogryn, connected by his magical abilities to the roots of the woods, who wears a great beard woven with moss and carries a twisted staff of living briarbracken wood that burns forever with the spirit-flame of the forest. His name is Gurptuk Moss-Beard, and none pass through his particular patch of Durham without his knowledge or permission.\r\n\r\nHow an Ogryn with expertise in the ways of the wood came to settle in an unusually peaceful part of Durham is a riddle many have sought to unravel. Some say that as a child Gurptuk wandered into the forest after being abandoned on its edge by his tribe, who were distrustful of the innate magical connection he held with woodlands. Others believe he was a Dark Elf slave who escaped and then tamed the forest around him. There are many theories besides.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it seems that, driven by sheer bloody-mindedness, Gurptuk carved out the clearing himself, and simply annihilated any and every beast or Dark Elf that tried to claim him. Among the latter was a Dark Elf sorcerer who Gurptuk turned into gnarled wood, and whose face he now bears on his back as a trophy. Certainly all agree that Gurptuk is a druid with a great affinity for the trees among which he makes his home, for he is one of the few beings who does not seem to have to adapt to the dark and deadly spirit of Durham, but can make it bend to his will instead.\r\n\r\nGurptuk’s own spirit is highly mercurial. Those who have encountered him are just as likely to declare that he turned their traveling companions into mushrooms for his brews as they are to claim that his nettle soup healed their grandmother’s gout. Gurptuk might render those who enter his clearing down into his latest ingredients, or he might get them drunk on fungus beer and tall tales before sending them on their wandering way, to be snapped up by the nearest bristlebark beast. A few he might even guide to safety. It seems as though he does not hold to common ideals of morality but is as unpredictable as the forest around him. When a visitor attracts his ire, however, his wrath is terrifying to behold. Such trespassers at best Gurptuk will pulverize with his biotic staff, or at worst find themselves prisoners trapped within his root cages, waiting to become part of the next brew that requires fresh elements.\r\n\r\nOf late, parts of the forest Gurptuk relies on are growing bare and fallow. Some say there is a malignant force at work within the woodland, some scheme set by Siroth or his minions. More and more, the Ogryn druid scavenges outside his domain, even beyond the edge of Durham, seeking out strange ingredients for a special elixir that will stop the rot and revitalize the woodland. Any allies he makes along the way have good cause to remain on their guard, for said concoction might need more than a few of their body parts.",

It is unclear whether he wanted the War of the Elves to happen, or if he merely supplied all the necessary tools and encouragement to make it possible. He certainly did not act alone – indeed, the Dreamwalker did nothing more than answer questions. It was his answers which latched into the psyche of so many Elves, and drew the Aravians apart like fishhooks pulling open a wound. No Elf asked as many questions of the Dreamwalker as Princess Lydia, daughter of the then Elven king.\r\n\r\nLydia was the youngest of her siblings, and she believed her distance from the throne insulated her from responsibility. She felt free to pursue paths considered by many Elves to be forbidden, and to consort with those a 'proper' Elf would find detestable. When the Dreamwalker began his visitations of the sleeping Elves of Aravia, Lydia was one of the first to listen. When the movement whose members would come to be called the Dark Elves crept into existence, she became its loudest mouthpiece, advocating with all the authority of royalty. When the rumors of shadow magic became too many to deny, Lydia was the first to admit that they were true, and argued that shadow magic was not the evil that so many claimed it to be.\r\n\r\nWhen the King of the Elves called a Conclave to resolve the Dreamwalker issue, Lydia was there, standing against her own father and siblings to defend the people who were in no small part her own. Her advocacy was so ardent, even when faced with accusations of necromancy, that she was eventually given the name Deathsiren – her song of rebellion and injustice was sweet, but it would prove deadly, for war followed the Conclave. In the conflict, Lydia fought for the Dark Elves. She solidified herself as one of the deadliest and most dangerous commanders of the war and destroyed all remaining ties to her family. When a second Conclave was held to try to end the war, Lydia was one of the loudest voices calling for formal separation between the Dark Elves and Aravian loyalists. When the two sides agreed, she led the largest group of Dark Elves into the cruel Durham Forest, head held high, intent on building a better society than what she saw as the corrupt and stagnant Aravia that she left behind.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Lydia's tale transitions from history to pure speculation. While she was seen by some as the Queen of the Dark Elves, she did not unify her people. Factionalism split the Dark Elves into dozens of different settlements, and their decline from righteous revolutionaries to chaotic anarchists left the Deathsiren's influence smaller and smaller as the years went by. Eventually she vanished entirely, never to be seen again – not even by those who depended on her vision of the future to guide them. Without a guiding hope and trapped in a highly dangerous forest, the Dark Elves twisted into a people who believed in only one truth: the weak are meat, and the strong do eat.\r\n\r\nMany ask what became of Lydia. Her mastery of magic and warfare should have made her one of the strongest warlords of the Dark Elves – if she could not do so through peaceful means, then she could have carved a swathe through Durham Forest and united its denizens by the sword, but instead she faded into myth. Many speculate that she did so by choice, but they cannot conceive of why.\r\n\r\nA few say that Lydia still lives. Even hundreds of years after the War of the Elves, rumors of the Deathsiren linger – huddled Dark Elves talk of dark magic and powerful witchcraft under the boughs of darkest Durham, or sometimes even sightings. But the sightings are strange: they say she has black wings, webbed with violent crimson energy. They claim she is a Demonspawn – an agent of Siroth. Was she a servant of the Lord of Shadow all along? Another pawn of the Dreamwalker? Was Princess Lydia the innocent she claimed to be in the Conclaves, or a collaborator with evil? Are sightings of her even real, or are they merely the wishful thinking of a people who lost their guiding light?\r\n\r\nThe Dark Elves may never know the truth. That the Deathsiren does still live, and she does now serve a higher master – one whose goals are as murky as the shadows of Durham. Whether she will come to save her people, or damn them, remains a mystery.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4720#static": "Just like the above-ground cities built by other species, the vast Dwarven undermountain metropolis of Gloomdeep Hold consists of crowded central districts and dangerous, sparsely populated outskirts. In the deepest and farthest tunnels, civilized Dwarven society and the reach of its laws and force of arms begin to fade into an unknowably, unthinkably vast underworld of unmapped caves and tunnels. From this abyss creep forth abominations, monsters unknown to surface dwellers and kept at bay through constant Dwarven vigilance. The 36th Patrol and its commanding officer, Acrizia, was just one cog in the vast machinery of that vigilance. Her patrols were crucial to the expansion of the frontier, for the good of her people and their ever-growing needs. \r\n\r\nEven so, every outing was a deadly roll of the dice. Though Acrizia and her shieldmates had vanquished giant spiders, blind albino great-bears, and foul troglodytic things that dwelt in dankness and stench, a cave-in was what felled them. When the dust cleared and the reverberations died down, Acrizia discovered she was the sole survivor, and with one leg snapped by a boulder, she seemed likely to join her dead comrades. But Dwarves give up nothing without a bitter show of stubbornness, so Acrizia crawled in agony amid the rubble, looking for a way out. Her excellent memory and orientation were useless – the terrain had been rearranged by the sudden quake and rockfall, and she was completely disoriented. \r\n\r\nSlowly bleeding to death and near despair, Acrizia heard a voice giving her clear, firm commands. She quickly understood it to be her own voice – not a mental monologue, but heard as though through her own two ears, a voice from her higher self taking command of her flagging spirit. The voice told her to keep going, that she was succumbing to shock and the chill of the underground. It reminded her of her standard issue flint and tinder ration, and she warmed herself. It coaxed back her old rock-knapping skills, and with typically ingenious Dwarven craftsmanship she was able to splint her broken leg and make a crude stone crutch.\r\n\r\nOther survivors of wilderness isolation scenarios, with no one to turn to in their direst need, have reported a similar voice-of-oneself phenomenon. In many cases it led to their salvation. In Acrizia’s case, there may be a more sinister explanation.\r\n\r\nOn the atheism of the Dwarves, a prefect of the Sacred Order once famously said: 'their folly is to disregard the gods, without guarantees that the gods disregard back.' Though the gods are held at great remove from Teleria and can influence it only tenuously, their reach is long and their yearnings are eternal. The gods that Acrizia had no instinct to pray to, even in crisis, may yet have called out to her. But which god? Let it be said only that the deep places are rarely friends of Light, but home of Darkness and Shadow.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the 36th's dead were eventually recovered, and the missing Acrizia given up as lost. When she re-entered known Telerian history, it is in a very different area of the Dwarven borderlands, far from the site of her disappearance. She was reportedly clad in a fierce horned helm and sinister spiked armor, bearing a blazing blade said to burn with the molten blood of the earth. Some said figures walked beside her, hunched and misshapen or else tall and eerie. Others dismissed them as a trick of the shadows cast by her burning sword. \r\n\r\nConcerned by the very idea of a maverick Dwarf, the Mountain King of Gloomdeep Hold dispatched elite Dwarven rangers to retrieve Acrizia, by force if necessary. Many did not return, and those who did had strange and contradictory explanations for their failures and the disappearances of their comrades. Many swore that their fellow rangers were drawn too close to Acrizia, following her as she evaded the rest of the patrol and then never regrouping. Subsequent encounters confirmed Acrizia was in fact followed by Dwarves, as well as the strange humanoid lurkers. \r\n\r\nThe Dwarf who came to be known as the Lost Daughter of the 36th continues to stalk those dark caverns that lie beyond the clockwork order of Gloomdeep Hold. But what purpose do Acrizia and her growing entourage serve, and what master? Soon, the world may know.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4750#static": "A lament sung by bards and poets of all cultures and nations, the sorrowful story of Siphi and Rotos is one that has transcended the peoples of Teleria. Following two star-crossed lovers brought together by their adventures across the ocean, they are torn apart by a jealous debt collector’s scheming – ending with Rotos avenging the murder of his beloved wife Siphi in a dramatic last stand. Orc, Human, Lizardman, Ogryn, and High Elf alike are known to weep at this finale, such is the power of the song.\r\n\r\nHowever, most people only hear of the dashing rogue Rotos, and what became of his spirit following his heroic sacrifice. Decades of bard songs across Anhelt have given more prominence to this gallant man from Arnoc, but in Siphi’s homeland of the Lost Isles, the poets weep deeply, singing at length about the fate of their beloved pirate sister. In their accounts, Siphi's wandering phantom crossed the seas back to her home – where she became a symbol of the perils of dealing with sailors from the continents. She meanders the cliffs and bays of the Lost Isles, her ghostly wails resounding across the water as she cries out for her fallen lover. Local fishermen do not dare to sail if they hear Siphi’s sobs – for it is surely a sign that misfortune and pain await on the turbulent waves.\r\n\r\nAs for ships from other lands, they dare not make landfall if they see the ghostly bride staring out to the horizon. Sailors tell of the mournful Siphi appearing on their ship, demanding where her beloved Rotos may be found. When sailors answer that he is not there, or that he is long dead, her sadness twists into fury. She tears apart the vessel in a white-hot rage, slaughtering all who she believes are hiding her husband from her. The wreckage of these boats then floats to shore – a single blue rose among the shattered planks and tangled ropes acting as the only clue to the horror that occurred.\r\n\r\nFor those kind sailors who try to bring Siphi back to her love, she's said to weep with joy as they head toward Rotos’ home in Arnoc. But as the sun rises and Arnoc is still out of reach, Siphi's form melts away, and all that remains is her haunted sobs. Those on board are said to be rendered inconsolable in their grief, never returning to the seas once they reach their destination.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Siphi waits, hoping that one day, a ship will bring Rotos back to her. It is an event that will never come.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4760#static": "Across Arnoc and Kaerok, everyone knows the tragic tale of Rotos and Siphi – two star-crossed lovers brutally murdered. Years before his death, Rotos had fled a money lender, to whom he owed a fortune he could not pay. More than a decade later he returned, rich from a life of piracy, and with Siphi, the love of his life. The usurer still harbored a deep hatred for Rotos, and while pretending all was forgiven once the debt was repaid, plotted his revenge. On Rotos and Siphi’s wedding day, armed thugs burst into the ceremony. They slaughtered the guests, pinned Rotos to the wall with spears, and butchered Siphi before his eyes. In their dying moments, both swore oaths of vengeance. When they were buried, their graves soured. Only two flowers could live in the defiled earth, a pair of eerie-blue roses.\r\n\r\nLegends unfold that as Rotos and Siphi were murdered separately, their souls were cursed to forever remain separate. As time passed, some say that they have risen back from their graves, swearing to destroy all who wronged them.\r\n\r\nThese stories grew out of the sudden deaths of the mercenaries who killed Siphi. Each corpse was discovered bearing the unmistakable mark of a thrust through the heart from a rapier – Rotos’ preferred weapon – and a rictus of pure terror. More unexplained murders followed. Blood-curdling screams and pleas for mercy were heard from Rotos’ usurer’s estate. When bodies were later discovered there, all bore looks of unbridled terror etched into their faces.\r\n\r\nEver since, the mysterious deaths of loan sharks, sellswords, and gangsters all over Anhelt and Peltas have all been blamed on the wrath of Rotos. The dead all sport the telltale signs: a single sword-thrust wound through the heart, and their visage twisted into one of pure horror. Some argue that these are mere copycat attacks, but they are few.\r\n\r\nNo-one knows for sure where Rotos' spirit now wanders. Some still claim a heart-rending howl echoes through the ruins of Rotos' family manor, while others swear they see eerie-blue roses placed by the form of a ghostly, weeping noble there, every year on the night of Siphi's murder. A handful insist they see Rotos’ spirit in the ports of Anhelt, looking in the direction of the Lost Isles, where his beloved Siphi is said to have hailed from. Wherever this roaming phantom now wanders, he surely longs for the embrace of his beloved, and the destruction of all those who share the lives of his killers.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4770#static": "The tale of Marquess Khoronar has been told before: how the haughty nobleman was cursed by the Arbiter for his callous ways and lived as an imprisoned beast, but was yet redeemed by his love for Minaya who loved him in turn. As it was told and re-told, often changed and abridged by mistake or for the sake of brevity, taste, and censorship, variations on its theme emerged, and the story was rubbed smooth of many details. Its archetype became embedded in the psyche of the Humans of Teleria, especially among the romantic Banner Lords, from whom the most detailed retellings derive.\r\n\r\nAt tale’s beginning, the marquess is a man of monstrous character in a Human body, and by its end his monster’s body holds a true man’s, much changed and purified. His redemption comes at the cost of much suffering, but that suffering does not break his will, it does not send him into a spiral of despair and self-pity. He continues to do right by himself and eventually learns to live for others as well. Most readily understand that Khoronar’s suffering and healing are an allegory for the fatal flaws all people possess and must address, and of the power of love and mutual compassion.\r\n\r\nBut there is another layer of meaning, less obvious in most tellings of the tale, but more clear in the earliest fragmentary versions based on first-hand accounts. Weaved into the story is a subtle but very real fear of Skinwalkers, and the spread of their bestial curse. Although in the story the righteous hand of the Arbiter is the one that damns Khoronar, every peasant hearing the tale knows that any one of them could also suffer the same fate but from cruel, random chance or lack of vigilance. All listeners know that the vivid accounts of Khoronar’s rampages aren’t drawn completely from imagination, but yield from so many generations’ traumatic memories of living with Skinwalkers.\r\n\r\nFaithful tellings, however, are more than a simple cautionary tale, for the Khoronar fable is one of redemption, and the Arbiter’s forgiveness in the tale is an allegory for what is possible for all Skinwalkers. Though they are permanently changed by their animal possession, their minds and their souls are still capable of tenderness and love, valor, and nobility. This story’s heart reassures listeners that the terrible Skinwalker curse does not have to truly mean the end.\r\n\r\nThe most fascinating thing for some, about Khoronar’s tale, is its end, or rather its lack of a definitive end. Each ending has Minaya slain and Khoronar triumphant but heartbroken, only for the Arbiter to appear once more and return Minaya to life in acknowledgement of Khoronar’s genuine turn of goodness. But afterward, the narratives diverge. The high chivalric tradition of Kaerok, with its romantic genre of literature, ends the tale with Khoronar returned to his Human form, restored to his lordly title with Minaya as his bride, their rule long and blessed. The Sacred Order’s hatred of Skinwalkers means that he can not, in official canon, remain one and be a respected ruler. But folk tellings from Kaerok and the Lands of Rebirth often omit the Arbiter’s lifting of the Skinwalker curse from Khoronar. In this rendition of the tale, he remains a Skinwalker and reigns regardless. This twist reveals the peoples’ fears and uncertainties regarding the mere possibility of a Skinwalker becoming a lord or a lord becoming a Skinwalker, and what would come of it. In yet another ending, Khoronar does not return to rulership at all, but still manages to live happily ever after with Minaya, leaving his land and title behind along with his arrogance and cruelty. This ending is most loved among peasants. \r\n\r\nAnd then there is the most fascinating ending of all… Some say that the Arbiter told Khoronar that his debt to the forces of goodness and Light was still unbalanced, and left Khoronar a Skinwalker, perhaps by his own choice. Minaya, having been raised from death by the Arbiter, refused to be parted from his side. And so, both of them offered their eternal service to the Light and had their souls bound to Shards. When the world reaches a crisis it cannot bear, and the end times descend, Minaya and Khoronar will return to the battlefield to save Teleria, or else fight to the last in the name of the Goddess.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4780#static": "Fiercely independent, famously beautiful, and known for her kind heart and bountiful spirit, Minaya is the archetype of the perfect noblewoman according to the romantic ideals of Banner Lord chivalric epics. But as with any historical figure, various facts are selectively brought to the fore or gently omitted as the tale is told, and a person quite different from the real Minaya emerges from the patchwork of legend.\r\n\r\nMost tellers of the tale introduce Minaya after describing the fall and Skinwalker curse of Khoronar, and his entrapment within his forsaken forest castle. She is hurt, exhausted, and vulnerable, having escaped an attempt on her life. Few storytellers care to elaborate on what led her to such a fate but some speculate that it was courtly politics, chauvinism, or oppressive traditions that set her to flight. Lords of Kaerok had vied fervently for her hand in marriage, not for the sake of love but for power and influence – and to capture a prize desired by all. But she wished to be guided by love, not politics, and held at bay the countless suitors who came to her with guileful and grasping hearts. Her refusal to compromise turned her admirers’ affections to jilted bitterness and for some, to burning hatred. A certain wicked baron dispatched assassins to end her, and Minaya was driven in desperation into Khoronar’s demesne. Thwarted and enraged, the baron seized her lands, using her prolonged absence as pretext. Despite Minaya’s story being their ideal of romantic love, the lords still pursue loveless political marriages to this day.\r\n\r\nIn Khoronar’s castle the Skinwalker nurses her back to health, but does not permit her to leave. The lonely and tormented Khoronar, desperate for any Human contact, had the good fortune of coming across a person of exceptional empathy, kindness, and courage both moral and physical. She was not afraid of his monstrous form, and she endured confinement at his hands because she knew what it felt like to live in fear of murderous pursuit. Neither Minaya nor Khoronar wanted either of their respective enemies to endanger the other. In their isolation together they found amity and, sure enough, love, for Khoronar the Skinwalker was much changed in temperament from Khoronar as he was as a heartless Human lord. Minaya pitied him and saw the goodness within him, which bloomed with every passing day they spent together. \r\n\r\nBut when he became aware of their deepening bond, Khoronar drove Minaya away in fury. He was not yet ready to be redeemed and forgive himself. When she tried to make her way back to her lands and her people, where her duties beckoned, she was attacked again by the baron’s assassins. Later seeing sense, Khoronar rushed to find Minaya and make amends, arriving in time to save her from the ambush. He was gravely wounded, so they retreated to his castle once more, and it was then that they finally confessed their love for each other. \r\n\r\nMinaya would have stayed with her love in exile were it not for her loyalty to her subjects. Once Khoronar was healed, Minaya left to attend to her homeland and duties. There she discovered the baron who had tried to kill her had usurped her title, and began a quest to gather support and retake her seat. Khoronar, distraught at her long absence, had a vision of her death in battle. He raced to her ancestral keep and arrived just as Minaya and her loyalists were assaulting the court room she had once called her own. Khoronar was ripping apart the baron's elite troops when the man fired his crossbow upon him, and Minaya dove into the path of its enchanted bolt, slain by it in Khoronar’s place. The eternal waltz that had weaved back and forth through the lives of Khoronar and Minaya had reached a bloody crescendo.\r\n\r\nEvery tale tells that this was not Minaya’s end. When Khoronar had slain the evil baron and all his men and finally paused to weep, the Arbiter appeared before him once more, and revived Minaya. The official texts of the Banner Lords say that the Arbiter also restored Khoronar to Human form, and that the two lovers lived happily ever after. Others claim both Minaya and Khoronar live on in Shards, and their tale continues beyond its fabled end.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4790#static": "Drokgul the Gaunt appears in legends spanning almost all of Teleria, renowned as a lonely Ogryn who wanders the wilderness. Most believe that in his quest for enlightenment he has become part of the landscape itself, as natural a phenomenon as the sunrise over the mountains, snows in winter, or the crash of the waves against Aravia’s craggy coast. Less known is that his wanderings were born out of rage.\r\n\r\nLike many Ogryn during the Gray Age, Drokgul was restless and quick to anger. After one clash too many with his kin, he was exiled from his home in the Redspike Mountains. In his rage he stormed away with no clear destination in mind, and simply kept going. On Drokgul walked, driven by his prodigious Ogryn stamina, encountering many peoples and places he had known nothing of before. He trekked with the Orcs in Kaerok, through the blistering sands of the Krokhan with the desert Nomads, and even reached the far-off Mistwood, where he lived for a while with the Sylvan, traveling from treetop to treetop.\r\n\r\nStep by step, the rage that had once defined him drained away. How could there be a place for thoughtless anger in a world as vast and varied as the one he now wandered? Over the years, Drokgul witnessed kindness and happiness and the desire of other communities to live peacefully. His travels brought him an inner stillness, and a new enlightenment that he slowly but surely explored. As his appreciation for the nature of Teleria itself grew, he felt a response from the magics of the land, from the rock and soil, and wind and rain. The energies of the elements filled him with fresh vigor, allowing him to continue what was now a quest for deeper understanding. Age and weariness became as unknown to him as they were to the great stones of the earth. For many years he walked, and life was good, though always he sought a keener knowledge of the meaning of his existence.\r\n\r\nEventually, Drokgul returned to the Redspike Mountains, to the great rock that was the seat of his tribe. He hoped to find the descendants of his people there, to express his regret at his past rage and share what he had learned, perhaps setting them upon their own path to enlightenment. To his dismay, however, he discovered that they were gone, their fate unclear, perhaps driven away or dispersed. Filled with sorrow, Drokgul settled upon the outcrop he had once played atop as a child, his back against a stony pinnacle, and reached into the earth with his elemental powers. He sought to be subsumed by Teleria itself, to become truly one with its nature, and so pass over into the magics of the land beneath him.\r\n\r\nDrokgul’s efforts were only partially successful. He awoke after centuries to find that his body and mind remained separate from the natural forces around him, though he was more connected to them than ever before. His skin was now rugged and rock-like, and his mind sang with the wind, cognizant of every blade of grass, every bird call.\r\n\r\nDrokgul was also aware of great pain. His spirit now bound so thoroughly to Teleria, he felt not only its untamable and wild soul but also its agony. Discord was growing across the land, as forces led by Siroth conspired to rip apart the world Drokgul knew and cherished. He realized he could not remain in the Redspike Mountains forever. If he was to ensure that Teleria was not destroyed, he would have to leave his home once more and fight.\r\n\r\nWhen Drokgul broke his stony bonds and dragged himself to his feet, it took time for him to fully awaken his own senses and overcome his shared agony. When he eventually did, he discovered that a new people had sprung into being around him. These people bore a striking resemblance to the roving Norr Drokgul had met on his ancient wanderings, and they had settled around his rock, not realizing that he was anything other than an extension of the stone beneath. At first they were terrified, but Drokgul convinced them that he meant no harm. Drokgul set about teaching them the ways of Teleria, seeing in them a kindred, wandering spirit, but he knew he could not remain for long. Bidding his new friends farewell, Drokgul recommenced his great trek. He took with him a boulder from the pinnacle he had rested against and chained it to his back as a symbol of his link to Teleria, determined to carry it with him always. His purpose now he believes is to preserve the sanctity and existence of Teleria, in defiance of the forces that would wreak destruction upon it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4800#static": "Of all the Undead, few bear a reputation for martial excellence or battlefield ruthlessness quite like Nekhret the Great. He is known by a host of titles – the Deathless Eagle, the Falcon of Eternity, the King of Bone and Iron, and many others besides. He has ruled a fiefdom within the barren Krokhan Desert for centuries. Down the ages, he has had many challengers, from barbaric Human chieftains and tribal Nomads to righteous paladins of the Church of Lumaya, not to mention rivals in Undeath. He has defeated them all. All lie crushed, their bones ground to powder, or resurrected to serve Nekhret for eternity.\r\n\r\nIn life, Nekhret was a warrior-king, a Deadlander of the Akar peoples and a founder of a great war-tribe that went on to establish a kingdom in the Krokhan Desert. According to Peltas’ many legends, he single-handedly fought a great and terrible sand wyrm, battling on to slay it even after it had ripped away part of his jaw. The wound proved fatal, but such was Nekhret’s determination that he swore even death would not end his reign. A year to the day after his passing, he broke free from his sarcophagus, slew the ‘usurper’ who had taken his place, and declared himself the eternal overlord of Krokhan. Whether this was because his relentless determination bested death itself, or whether the ground where he first perished fighting the sand wyrm was cursed, and transmuted itself into his bones, none can say.\r\n\r\nBe it in generalship and grand strategy, single combat in a whirling melee, or clashing against a monstrous or beastly foe, Nekhret delights in all forms of warfare. Rarely does an enemy best him and even then, their victory is fleeting, for Nekhret always returns. He is relentless in seeking to settle old scores, and will hunt rivals and heroes across Peltas and beyond, before accepting that any are his superior.\r\n\r\nIn battle, Nekhret fights in a panoply befitting an immortal warrior-king. Upon his broken skull sits the carrion helm, the raggedy crimson feathers of its crest bleeding dark energies that disturb the dead wherever he walks. Strapped across one arm is the Shield of the Mortis Eagle, once part of the lid of his sarcophagus and, to the Nomads of the Krokhan, a potent omen of the inevitability of death. Nekhret’s unyielding gauntlet is eternally clenched around the Tomb Glaive, a mighty weapon so potent with necromantic magics that as soon as a mortal falls to its bitter bight, their corpse is resurrected again in Nekhret’s service. With such arms and armor already augmenting his fearsome abilities, this great champion of undeath is all-but unstoppable on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nNekhret is bold and boastful, and despises weakness above all things. He views mortals as inherently inferior to the Undead, those he sees as having mastered death, and never hesitates to dispatch a foe, whether he deems the challenge they have offered up as worthy or not. Other Corrupted he only truly respects if they have shown martial worth of their own, and he expects all fellow Undead to be subservient to him should they wish to fight by his side. It is believed that Nekhret holds particular contempt for Siroth, whose overweening control is anathema to such a proud king. This dislike extends to Siroth’s vampiric spawn. As far as Nekhret is concerned, vampires are little more than parasitic vermin masquerading as true Undead. It is an unusual battle indeed where he accepts being on the same side as a vampire, whether mighty and ancient or just freshly-turned.\r\n\r\nNekhret’s ultimate goals are known only to him. Some believe he seeks to expand his grip beyond the Krokhan dunes and seize either the legendary arena city of Velyzar or the corrupted settlement of Ireth, both of which he claims fall within his realm. This would certainly be a step on the road to claiming the whole of Peltas, and maybe even beyond. Others are convinced Nekhret the Great simply seeks a worthy challenge in his continual quest to become the ultimate warrior. Whatever his true goal, Nekhret can be confident of one thing – he has eternity with which to achieve it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4810#static": "Few acolytes of the Cult of K’Leth ever see the headquarters of the Knights Revenant, the cursed isle of Perdition. A bleak place of mist and cold stone, it is the nexus of the Cult’s operations and the home of Losan K’Leth himself. Common cultists yearn to make a pilgrim’s journey to its craggy shores, hoping to receive the favor of the great K’Leth himself, but most know that only their children stand a real chance of one day seeing the place.\r\n\r\nAmong the jagged buildings that bristle across the barren isle is a school, named Umbral. It is a place of stone columns and perpetual shadow, the scrape of quills on parchment and the clack of slow, armored footfalls the only noises permitted in its grim halls and dormitories. Here, children of the cult who show particular promise – be it academic, magical, or military – are brought, ostensibly to be further educated in the ways of K’Leth, though there is an even more vital purpose to their work.\r\n\r\nUmbral is administered and maintained by a dedicated group of Knights Revenant, and only a few among their ranks are more infamous than Rector Drath. She ensures discipline in the institute, while she can also benumb flesh to dull pain and fuse broken bones with her magic, allowing her to act as a physician. It is said that she once ran a similar institution for orphans maintained by the Sacred Order, and that she was one of Losan K’Leth’s first converts. The structure of Umbral does indeed seem to be based on the Sacred Order’s foundling institutions, but the things taught within could not be more different from Lumayan dogma.\r\n\r\nDrath is unstinting in her duties. Besides regulating the institute’s discipline, she instructs various classes herself, most of them martial in nature or relating to the histories and heraldries of the Knights Revenant. She readily lashes the bared palms of the wayward or inattentive with a switch rod, or strikes them with the haft of her scepter of authority, making no attempt to conceal her natural cruelty. The mere sound of her footsteps accompanied by the swish of her black and gray dress is enough to quell most mischief-making.\r\n\r\nRector Drath is feared and hated by her charges, though the youths of Umbral also have reason to be thankful of her constant presence. The dead do not rest easy on Perdition. Umbral has been attacked by reanimated corpses or unquiet spirits, often the dead of shipwrecked vessels who drag themselves up from the icy, crashing waves, hungry for warm flesh and blood. During such assaults Drath plays her part in the defense, for she has many skills in the art of necromancy. With her booming, matriarchal voice she can master the ghosts of the lost and force them to obey her, while the scepter that acts as her badge of authority doubles as a heavy mace – with it she smashes the skulls and breaks the bones of any who would violate the institute. She can also part ways with her own body, taking on a spirit form and walking the halls unseen, ensuring none break Umbral’s strict curfews or violate its grounds.\r\n\r\nUmbral helps secure the future of the Cult of K’Leth, but its secret and most vital function is as a testing ground to discover potential future Soul Shepherds. Like the other overseers of the institute, Drath is always monitoring her pupils for those who show arcane aptitude. The dreaded Rector singles out worthy candidates and removes them from their classes. Only then can their true training begin.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4850#static": "Ogryn tend to be viewed as brutal and unsubtle beings, but few of those appellations apply to Skraank's people. His tribe is one of many that lurks in the caverns beneath the Dawnmounts, their number wiry, lean, hunched, and more at home in dark, dank tunnels and deep crevasses than on the rugged plains or steep slopes that many other Ogryn call home.\r\n\r\nSkraank was born with even more heightened abilities than those common to his kind, his long, bat-like ears allowing him to detect the presence of individuals from the vibrations they cause in the air. Conversely, while his large eyes allow him to see perfectly in the dark, even mild sunlight leaves Skraank blinded. When traveling above ground, he therefore adopts metal disks with slender slits that keep out the worst of the glare.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age, Skraank realized how different he and his people were from many other Ogryn tribes. He found he was quicker, more cunning, and could achieve far more by planning and stealth than others could with brute force. He delighted in pulling practical jokes, stealing, and generally sowing chaos. As he grew, the roles of thief, spy, and assassin came naturally to him and, not content with remaining forever beneath the Dawnmounts like so many of his tribe, he chose to walk abroad in the world and hire out his skills to those in need of subtle and deadly solutions to their problems.\r\n\r\nSkraank has mastered the art of death in numerous ways, and his weaponry reflects his versatility. He wields two short swords, Gizzard-Gouger and Gut-Gorer, with a speed and skill few other Ogryn – even those from Skraank’s own tribe – are able to match. Should these not be enough, he carries two long knives, former swords belonging to a knight of Kaerok that Skraank slew by driving Gut-Gorer’s slender blade through his helmet’s eye-slit. He also possesses a heavy crossbow, once a defensive fixture onboard a Dwarf treasure ship that Skraank 'liberated'. An array of short throwing daggers completes his armament, meaning that whether his targets are lightly or heavily armored, or engaging at close or long range, he always has the right tools for the job.\r\n\r\nWhile Skraank is a killer in no uncertain terms, solo assassinations are not where his true talents lie, and nor do they bring him true joy. His greatest love remains sowing havoc through disruption and sabotage. Such are his skills he can trick enemies into believing they are being attacked by far more than just one creature. One Banner Lord named Sir Delane, jealous of the extent of the neighboring noble’s holdings, secretly hired Skraank to raid his rival’s territory. The man was convinced by the destruction Skraank wreaked that a powerful Orc raiding party were striking the area. Delane’s rival surrendered part of his land in exchange for Delane’s military assistance – the 'Orc raids' ended soon after.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, the Ogryn Gutbrawlers tribe hired Skraank to help defeat a force of Aravian colonizers seeking to expand their holdings in western Peltas. During the night, Skraank mounted repeated, sudden, and violent assaults on the Aravian sentries. This, coupled with one of his favorite disruptive techniques – setting fires amid tents and supply wagons – caused the whole camp to degenerate into chaos, leaving them unprepared when the main Ogryn attack came in the morning.\r\n\r\nSkraank keeps a tally of successful assignments scraped into the scraps of armor he wears. The notches are starting to take up all available space, but Skraank has no intention of stopping – not while his fiendish addiction to creating havoc and destruction remains unsatiated.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4860#static": "Even among his fellow Knights Revenant, Fortus is an enigma. Believed to be either a founding member of the Cult of K’Leth, or at least one of its first adherents, he is an ancient, baleful presence that seems to occupy a nebulous space, at once on the fringes of the cult, and within its inner circle. Fortus rarely speaks, and when he does it feels as though his words echo around directly within the listener’s head, rather than first reaching their ears. His declarations are heeded and his commands obeyed by all but the most foolish or powerful of the other Knights Revenant.\r\n\r\nFortus has long cultivated his own adherents within the wider Cult of K’Leth. Acolytes who fall under his sway hail him as the Knight of Oblivion, and hold him almost as a demigod – the disturbing, tentacled visage of his helmet is recreated in shrines, upon shields, and as tokens and necklaces. Within this group he decides who will be blessed with soul transposition, and his apparent seniority among Knights Revenant make him a figure worthy of particular reverence for many cultists further afield. This bloc within the Cult of K’Leth certainly enhances his standing, to such an extent that some other Knights Revenant fear he may one day head a schism.\r\n\r\nNobody knows Fortus’ origins, nor have they even seen what lies beneath his strange, disturbing helm. This is probably for the best, it is argued by those who know him, as his true identity would surely be too much for the sanity of both mortals and immortals alike. Perhaps due to the cephalopod-styled crafting of his wargear, some claim he hails from the Lost Isles. Maybe he was the captain of a long-since wrecked ship, or the leader of a band of seaborne mercenaries. A particularly intractable belief among his servants and acolytes is that he was the king of one of the Lost Isles that was submerged forever beneath a vast tidal wave long ago. In this theory Fortus alone survived, spared by fate for a higher purpose. Fortus neither confirms nor denies such claims, but his actions are certainly those of one well-accustomed to being the bearer of authority.\r\n\r\nIn battle, Fortus wields a huge broadsword known as the Voidreaper. The weapon seems to possess an uncertain nature, its blade constantly flickering, as though it isn’t wholly present in the reality which Teleria occupies. It can phase through the heavy armor of a knight of the Sacred Order, the muscle of an Ogryn, and the throat scales of a Lizardman warrior with equal ease, and send the souls of its victims tumbling into oblivion. In truth, however, the accursed sword is the least deadly of Fortus’ armaments.\r\n\r\nAny who are in Fortus’ presence cannot help but suffer a deeply unpleasant, unsettling sensation. Some describe it as a physical discomfort, such as a biting cold or a splitting headache, while others find their mind wandering to terrible things, confronting their own mortality or pondering the yawning horrors of oblivion. For his own part, Fortus seems to do nothing to inspire these experiences, but when his ire is roused, or he specifically directs his will while in combat, the effect is even more pronounced. Opponents collapse, screaming, or claw at themselves in bouts of insanity as their greatest fears are realized and their mental defenses crumble as they find their minds beset by nightmares spawned out of a realm that no being in Teleria should ever be exposed to. Even other Knights Revenant seem discomforted by the Knight of Oblivion's presence, and no one can quite banish the sensation of clammy, suckered tentacles sliding over their throats and shoulders or latching around their wrists and ankles whenever he fixes his attention on them.\r\n\r\nQuite what Fortus is, or what his ultimate goals are, remain as enigmatic as the Knight Revenant himself. The only certainty is that mere mortals will not long withstand the future he has planned with either their bodies, or their souls, intact.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4880#static": "The Dwarves have an affinity for rock and stone. They spend most of their time beneath Teleria’s surface, digging new tunnels or uncovering old ones. They seek out hard-to-reach seams of ore with which to craft technological wonders, and carve paths down into the roots of the mountains to expand their realms. While much of this is accomplished by the humble pick and shovel-work of the Tunneling Guilds of Gloomdeep Hold and the Skyiron Dominion, some tunnels require a more specialized form of digging; the magical art known as geomancy.\r\n\r\nGeomancy involves the manipulation of rock by force of mind; only the most stubborn of souls can become skilled in its practice for, to be a Geomancer, a Dwarf must match their will against that of the mountains themselves. As such, Geomancers are rare. Those who display any aptitude at all for the artform are immediately snatched up by the Tunneling Guilds and trained to use their abilities for the good of their people, whether they wish to do so or not. \r\n\r\nA Geomancer learns to commune with the stone, and how to manipulate the fissures that permeate mountains. They guide Guild sapper teams to weak spots in the rock face, sniff out seams of valuable ore, and can hear a mountain's warnings of the approach of subterranean monsters such as rock-spiders or cave-apes. They are also adept at shaping stone, allowing them to open up new tunnels. For these reasons, Geomancers are often at the forefront of every Skyiron delving expedition. \r\n\r\nBut not every Geomancer remains in the employ of the Tunneling Guilds. Some few break their contracts and go into business for themselves. One is Durok Sunblight. \r\n\r\nDurok was once a humble sapper, meant for a life of carving timing runes for magical explosives to open up new routes through the earth. But one day a mislaid rune caused a cave-in, of which Durok was the only survivor. Buried there, in the bowels of the earth, Durok heard the mountain speak to him, albeit not in words. Rather, some force rose within him and allowed him to mystically shift the tons of rock that had trapped him and carve himself a path to freedom. As this force flowed through him, he felt stronger than he ever had before, and as he emerged into the torchlight of his would-be rescuers, Durok wished he could continue to dig… and dig… and dig. \r\n\r\nWhen word spread of Durok's feat, a Tunneling Guild soon came calling. At first, Durok was reluctant to go with them, fearing that they might punish him for his unauthorized use of magic. But when he realized that they intended to train him to better use the power he’d felt within him, he was only too eager to go. \r\n\r\nBut the training was slow, meticulous, and cautious. Too cautious, in Durok’s estimation. The power within him demanded to be put to use in ever more inventive ways, and he was only too happy to oblige it. He could turn solid stone to dust and back, cause tremors, and even petrify living things. But his Geomancy tutors refused to allow him to continue his experiments. Forcing him at every turn to keep to the rigid path they set out for him.\r\n\r\nDurok’s refusal to cease his experimentation saw him drummed from the Tunneling Guild, and prohibited from using his magic on pain of imprisonment or worse. But Durok had decided that such rules no longer applied to him. Employing his powers as he sees fit, he travels from place to place one step ahead of the authorities, offering up his services to any who will offer him the opportunity to explore the limits of his abilities.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4900#static": "Harima grew up laboring in the mines the Mikage were carving into Yakai. Despite the hardships she faced, she steadfastly endured while so many around her broke, refusing to give up on the hope of freedom.\r\n\r\nWhile the excavation of iron ore was the primary purpose of the mine where Harima toiled, it was also the location of a portal to the infernal realm of Anathraad, and its overseer, a brutal Demonspawn named Zeomani the Delver, had a taste for other diversions, especially pit-fighting and gladiatorial challenges staged between workers and slaves brought from other mines. These were indulged by the Mikage’s other leaders as the most successful combatants could be conscripted into the Mikage’s armies, and the presence of the portal in Zeomani’s mines made him an important member of the Autocracy.  \r\n\r\nDespite her young age, Harima soon proved herself a capable fighter in Zeomani’s combat bouts. Still, the Demonspawn required even the best potential warriors to continue laboring in the mines until the next recruiters from the Mikage’s armies visited. In a way this was fortunate for Harima, for one day the section she had been assigned to excavate yielded an unexpected discovery.\r\n\r\nA long-buried, dirt-encrusted bag proved to contain a dao, a weapon with a spear-like shaft and a long, curving blade. Its style was akin to that of the ancient weapons of Yakai, but it was still wickedly sharp and showed no signs of rust or decay. Harima concealed the weapon back in the cut she was excavating, covering it with rubble. She kept it a secret, for she knew Zeomani would not only seize it from her, but might well also use it to execute her.\r\n\r\nHarima continued her labors, covertly moving the weapon with her the further into the mine she progressed. Her star continued to rise within the fighting pits, but all the while she worked to secretly foment rebellion, laying plans that would see Zeomani banished and the mine’s slaves freed.\r\n\r\nEventually, the day came when Harima felt confident enough to strike. Smuggling the dao to the edge of the arena in one of the rubble carts used in the mines, she waited until Zeomani was seated on his throne before the pulsing portal to Anathraad before claiming she had a gift for him, recovered from the mines. In his vanity, Zeomani permitted her to approach carrying the dirty bag, only for her to whip the dao free. The blade proved as keen as she had hoped, and lent its razor edge to her strength. With a single fell blow, Harima cut Zeomani’s head from his shoulders.\r\n\r\nUproar gripped the mine as the workers Harima had hatched her schemes with seized the opportunity to rise up. The uprising would likely have been crushed, but the guards had not accounted for Harima’s ferocity, or the weapon that she seemed to wield as though she had trained with it all her life. She blocked the entrance to the portal, its magical energies suffusing her as she slew all who sought to escape. After the last of the Demonspawn attempting to cross through were slain, the miners collapsed a section of the cavern upon the doorway between dimensions, burying it in a cave-in. In the bloody aftermath of the uprising Harima, though touched by the darkness of Siroth’s realm, stood victorious. She took Zeomani’s head as a trophy, and bound it to her belt.\r\n\r\nAfter gaining her freedom, Harima decided to continue her resistance against the Autocracy’s rule. She carried on hunting Mikage autocrats and their followers. Zeomani’s death and the closing of the portal had given her a purpose, and her renown rapidly grew as she added more of Siroth’s minions to her tally. The famous Helm of the Dawnlands, which had belonged to the chief of one of the clans of old, she retook from the Demonic Marshal Ru, while the Cloak of Jade Feathers, a symbol of ancient Yakai kingship, she liberated from the Black Citadel of Akoda. Soon she was known as the Knight of the Dawnlands and the Arch Demonslayer, a modern Yakai fable that struck fear into even the most arrogant of Demonkind.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mikage were eventually overthrown by the forces of rebellion, Harima found that her work was still far from done. She continued to hound down Mikage Demonspawn who evaded the purge, severing their heads and sealing shut the portals they used to attempt to bring more of their kind to Yakai. Her destruction was soon eagerly sought by the Demons of Anathraad, and yet she continued to prove to be the bane of every spawn of Siroth sent against her.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4920#static": "Purity can only be achieved through pain. Body and mind must be purged of weakness. Only then can one know the true love of Lumaya. Only then can one truly serve her. Or so the renegade known as Corvis the Corruptor insists. \r\n\r\nClad in the beaked mask and the grim robes of a Sacred Order battle-surgeon, Corvis wanders Teleria, spreading the gospel of purity-through-plague. Wherever he goes, sickness and death are sure to follow. His mask weeps fumes of decay, and the great sword he bears drips with tainted effluvia. In his wake, he leaves towns and villages consumed by maladies that no doctor or priest can hope to allay. If there is any truth to his claim that those who survive his deadly gifts are destined to serve Lumaya in some fashion, not even his former compatriots in the Sacred Order can say. \r\n\r\nCorvis’ origins are lost to rumor and hearsay. Some insist he is not a man, but a pestilence that walks – a servant of Siroth, unleashed to punish those who follow the tenets of Lumaya. Others believe him to be a man suffering under a malign curse, doomed to destroy those he tries to save. \r\n\r\nBut among the leaders of the Sacred Order, it is known that Corvis was once one of their own. A doctor and an alchemist of no small repute, Corvis had found his faith late in life and had joined the Sacred Order as a humble Novitiate. He was accepted and dispatched to an isolated mission in the Lost Isles, where sickness was rife and it was thought that his skills might be of some use. \r\n\r\nNot long after his arrival, a strange illness struck down the inhabitants of the mission, claiming many of their number. The afflicted were wracked with fever, their flesh covered in boils. The few survivors were left disfigured wrecks. Corvis worked like a man possessed to combat the disease, but every day brought new cases and new deaths. Soon, even the Mother Superior of the mission fell ill and had to be confined to her bed, where she ranted and raved about the illness being a curse from Lumaya. Nonetheless, Corvis prayed to the Goddess every waking hour that he wasn’t writing in his journals or tending the sick, hoping for some sign that might lead him to a cure. But as the days dragged on, and more bodies were consigned to the pyres, his faith curdled into obsession. \r\n\r\nCorvis began to believe that perhaps the Mother Superior was right. Perhaps Lumaya’s lack of reply was surely a sign in and of itself. That the sickness was not a natural affliction but a test of faith and will. A test that only he had passed; for was he not healthy? One of the few unaffected by the rampant fevers and convulsions that gripped the rest? Their faith had been wanting, and so they suffered, and in suffering they might well be purged of their weakness. \r\n\r\nBut what of those who hadn’t endured the sickness? They were not like him, he knew. He had been in close proximity to the sick, and not caught the illness. The others who were unaffected had kept their distance, avoiding contact with the afflicted. He realized that they too had to be tested, else what was it all for? \r\n\r\nIn the days that followed this revelation, Corvis concocted a plan to test those who were so far unscathed. He collected samples of pus and bile from his patients and added them to the mission’s food and water supply. Soon, the entire mission was gripped with an even more virulent strain of the fever. More deaths followed, until the few survivors were forced to send for rescue. When a relief ship arrived at last, it was too late. Every inhabitant of the mission was either dead, or a broken lunatic.\r\n\r\nAll save Corvis, who was nowhere to be found. \r\n\r\nBut he had left his journal behind. And when its contents were read, the Sacred Order immediately began a vain search for the former Novitiate. He was never found, though they still hunt him, dispatching their agents to scour Teleria for any hint of his comings and goings. It is not known what fate they intend for him, though it is probably not good. \r\n\r\nOf late, it is whispered by some that Corvis has been seen in Kaerok, Aravia, and even Ireth. Regardless of the location, the story is always the same… entire villages and towns consumed by a strange sickness, of fever and boils, and a wandering doctor who records the suffering in his journal. Those few who survive, broken in both body and mind, claim to have been blessed by Lumaya… and purified of their weaknesses by Corvis the Corruptor.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4930#static": "The tale of Samson the Masher, notorious and wildly successful gladiator of the Arena City of Velyzar, begins hundreds of miles from the colossal stadia, howling crowds, brilliant banners, and decadent refreshments of that storied place, on a rugged island vastly removed from luxury and fame. South-west of Nyresa are numerous such small islands inhabited by tribes long isolated from wider civilization. Their traditional hunting and gathering societies have not changed for many centuries and actively resist incursions from the outside world. Besides them, the only permanent population is composed of outlaws, exiles, pirates, and dissidents living in various weather-beaten shantytowns. \r\n\r\nLegend has it that a crew of buccaneers returned to one of their regular haunts with a foundling – a swaddled child, almost a baby, with an ape-like body and thick, matted hair, who could speak only brokenly in the dialect of the local islanders. When one pirate identified the baby as a Skinwalker, many were fearful and called for the child to be killed. But the towering lady Orc who served their drinks would have none of it, and none of the pirates dared upset the source of their daily tipple. So it was that the child was adopted by the whole town and grew to boyhood among the beached ships and ramshackle huts that made up its architecture, playing in the sand and using his incredible strength to help with chores.\r\n\r\nBut though these flint-hearted folk were kind to the gorilla Skinwalker they came to call Samson, at their core they were still ruthless pirates. One day, when Samson was nearing adulthood, a foppish High Elf nobleman and his cortège happened upon the island. The Elf was fascinated with Samson and offered a heaping chest of silver to purchase the teenage Skinwalker as a curiosity. The corsairs could not resist. Heartsick and betrayed, Samson brooded in his cabin aboard the High Elf’s ship. But as they entered the safety of coastal waters and neared port, he spotted the pillars, domes, and lighthouses of the great nexus of Velyzar, and was amazed. When his High Elf owner saw Samson emerge from belowdecks to better see the sights, he marked it well and when they docked, he led Samson ashore not in chains but as an equal, and together they toured the city. Samson was awed by the bazaars, enraptured with the women, and thrilled to eat exotic foods. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the High Elf noble spoke with him, explaining his plan. He began by assuring Samson that his deal with the vagabond islanders had no legal legitimacy in civilized lands. Samson was free to go and the Elf had no power over him. But with the Elf’s patronage and Samson’s brawn, a fortune could be made and both would profit by it. All Samson had to do was follow the High Elf’s instructions and forgive the matter of having been forcibly parted from his adoptive family.\r\n\r\nSamson mulled this offer. He found the Elf’s words reasonable, but could plainly see the Aravian was vain and manipulative, wealthy in excess and to the detriment of his moral character. So Samson resolved to accept the offer and gain wealth and power by any means, but that he would never forgive. He vowed to make the haughty Elf pay some day, and feel the same shame of being bought and sold like a commodity. \r\n\r\nSamson was trained in Velyzar’s famous fighting pits, choosing to fight with his own two fists enhanced with brass cladding. His distinct appearance and unusual origin garnered much attention, and he thrashed all comers and rose swiftly through the ranks. Fight money and endorsement earnings were shrewdly reinvested. But soon the High Elf grew nervous about his protégé’s growing wealth, influence, and autonomy. \r\n\r\nOn the third anniversary of Samson’s debut, the Elf awoke to find a chest of silver delivered to him – counting it, he understood that it totaled Samson’s price, repaid, plus one extra coin, as if to declare that it wasn’t over yet. In the months that followed, Samson used his rising celebrity to bully the Elf out of deal after deal, drying up his former master’s business connections, collapsing the Elf’s circle of friends, and making them his own. Too proud to cut his losses, the Elf struggled for some years before finally admitting defeat. He left, furious, for his ancestral estates in Aravia. Samson was satisfied to see his revenge exacted, but with his goal achieved, Samson will need to find new motivation for the challenges that will surely face him.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4940#static": "For those members of the Sacred Order who dare defy its strictures, there are several means of exculpation. The most common is trial by combat. The accused must face a champion chosen by the Order, with ‘Lumaya’s blessing’ determining the victor. Many in the Order, however, find this to be an unsatisfactory method of punishment. They regard another method as more certain in regards to guilt and innocence. \r\n\r\nThe trial known as Lumaya’s Flame consists of the accused being chained in place, slathered in boiling pitch and set alight. As they burn, they are made to recite the Five Canticles of Devotion. Those who complete the recitation, as their body is engulfed in flames, are forgiven their sins and the fires are doused. That the accused rarely survive is a small price to pay to be certain of their innocence, or so the Order claims. \r\n\r\nThose who survive the trial are forever marked by it; not just in body, but often in mind. Such scalding pain can break even the strongest will. In the centuries since the trial was first enacted, only one man has come out the other side of it with sanity intact. That man is Mordecai, the most infamous of the Bearers of the Flame, those servants of the Order who are chosen to administer the trial. \r\n\r\nMordecai was once a humble Preacher. His duties were minimal, largely confined to moral instruction and the collection of tithes from the local congregations. But Mordecai was also impious and greedy. He had joined the Order solely to escape the hangman’s noose, and though he claimed to have mended his ways, in truth he had merely found new means of disguising his chicanery. He skimmed the tithes he collected and used his position to bully others so that none dared speak against him. \r\n\r\nBut Mordecai was eventually undone by his own greed, when his superiors discovered that he was selling merciful sentences. That a Preacher had engaged in such flagrant and foolish corruption was regarded as intolerable, and Mordecai was immediately arrested. His request for a trial by combat was then denied when it was learned he’d attempted to bribe his accusers into letting him win. Instead, Mordecai was sentenced to face Lumaya’s Flame.\r\n\r\nMordecai was chained and set alight even as he protested his innocence. But in the moment that the first spark caught, and the first tongue of flame licked across his flesh, something changed in him. Mordecai recited the Canticles hesitantly at first, for he only barely knew them, then with more confidence. The words filled his head and tumbled from his lips. As he spoke, the pain began to fade and it was as if someone spoke through him, a presence more powerful than any he’d felt. It filled him, driving out all thought of the flames. The hotter the fire grew, the more serene he felt… as if it were eating away at his myriad sins. \r\n\r\nLater, some would insist that Mordecai had simply gone mad from pain. Others swore that Lumaya herself had bestowed her grace upon the burning man, showing that even the most sinful of her children could be redeemed through flame. All agreed however that when Mordecai finished his recitation, the fire was snuffed as if by magic.\r\n\r\nNot even his accusers could deny that Mordecai was a changed man thereafter. Now, swathed in bandages and rendered mute by his agonies, he acts as a Bearer of the Flame, and offers others the same chance at redemption he was given.",

He greeted the chief shaman of the clan, Skalrag, and claimed that his parents, whom he called the ‘Skymother and Skyfather’ had left him to Skalrag’s care. The shaman was, apparently, to raise Gomlok and teach him what sorcerous knowledge he did not yet know.\r\n\r\nSuch a bold claim would likely have been met with derision, were it not for two factors. Gomlok proved his magical talent by draining a nearby tree of life and restoring it. Secondly, his pallid blue skin, a match for the heavens above, was taken by some within the clan as proof that his incredible story was true. The Gulraz were an especially superstitious Orc clan, and had long worshiped Lumaya in a form as a light-giving sky deity. To some of them, Gomlok's mysterious appearance truly was a sign from the Goddess.\r\n\r\nAccepting this, Skalrag agreed to train and raise Gomlok. He found he had little to teach the young Orc, whose talents were formidable, and it was not long before Skyhide took his place among the clan’s shamanistic magic-wielders. While he would admit it to no others, he had little memory of a time before he had awoken on the edge of Gulraz territory, but his beliefs about his origins were sincere. One day, he claimed, he would return to the great azure, and assume his place among his divine kin.\r\n\r\nWhile some believed this, some thought it mere trickery, for Gomlok often showed a particular grasp for deception in his magic. When a rampaging gang of Ogryn looked set to fall on the Gulraz, Gomlok threw up an illusion that made the brutes think there was a grand feast waiting for them just over the next ridge line in the opposite direction, a trick that continued to exert its influence over them from one eminence to another, until they were far from Gulraz territory. On another occasion, he cast a glamor over many of the clan’s pots and pans, making them appear to be priceless treasures. When a powerful Orc warlord named Skornthax passed through and demanded tribute, the clan surrendered their cookware to him. To this day, Skornthax believes the battered metal implements to be among his most prized possessions, with those few who can see through the spell too afraid to tell the infamously murderous brute the truth.\r\n\r\nGomlok’s abilities saw him acting as an advisor for a succession of the Gulraz’s elected chiefs, and a strategist on the rare occasions when the clan found itself with no choice other than to go to war. Privately he pushed the limits of his own abilities over time, and tampered with darker magics, hoping that they might unlock the key to his past and presage his return to the heavenly realms. During one arcane ceremony, the arcane energies got out of control and knocked down huts, burned food stocks, and freed livestock from their pens that then fled the devastation.\r\n\r\nBy some miracle, no one was killed, but for the first time in his life, Gomlok had experienced a check on his abilities. His confidence shaken, he became concerned about what other damage he could cause to his adoptive people. He exiled himself before the aging Skalrag and the council of shamans could pronounce a judgment against him.\r\n\r\nFor years, Gomlok wandered among other clans, selling his services as a warrior-shaman to the highest-paying warband. While he never again delved as deeply into dark magics as he had before his self-imposed exile, he steadily branched out into them once more, mastering deadlier forms of combat arcanistry. Still, he swiftly grew bored with the mercenary lifestyle, believing he was destined for greater things. He felt something more calling to him, something from above.\r\n\r\nBelieving that his Skymother and Skyfather were seeking his return, Gomlok set out alone on a quest of self-discovery. He believed that there was some arcane knowledge, some fragment of power that he needed to acquire before he would be taken back to the heavens, to a divine existence that he believed he had been separated from in his younger years. To that end, Skyhide ventured into the burning heat of the Krokhan Desert, where he hoped he might commune with a high power and perhaps, when the time is right, ascend to a higher plane.",

Especially for one whose bones bear the taint of an unholy malediction. Such a being is Vogoth the Accursed. \r\n\r\nOnce a mighty knight in service to the Banner Lords of Kaerok, Vogoth is now a lumbering, lurching pustule of necromantic foulness… a decaying hulk, whose very presence causes the waters to sour and the trees to wither.\r\n\r\nCenturies ago, Vogoth served his lord faithfully and well, facing enemies both on and off the battlefield. For him there was no greater glory than in a deed honorably done or an innocent life preserved. But even the most heroic of warriors has enemies. \r\n\r\nIt is said by some that an honorable warrior is an asset on the battlefield and a hindrance everywhere else. Such was the case with Vogoth. He disapproved of the fierce politicking of the court of Kaerok, and unwittingly hindered his lord's attempts to increase his own influence at the cost of others, on more than one occasion. Finally, Vogoth's lord decided to dispense with his services. But he could not simply dismiss the knight, and risk Vogoth joining a rival's retinue. Nor could he simply have him killed, for there were those who might suspect the truth and use it for their own ends. Instead, Vogoth's end had to look like an accident… death by misadventure. \r\n\r\nSo, Vogoth was dispatched to the Gasping Mire, where a nest of Undead were said to be lurking. The nearby villages had long begged their lord to end the threat of the dead things in the swamp, and they were overjoyed by Vogoth's arrival. The knight was accompanied by a group of eleven of his lordship's handpicked men; stalwart warriors, who could be counted on to accomplish the task alongside him. \r\n\r\nTwelve men went into the mire. But only eleven returned. It was claimed that Vogoth had died ending the Undead threat, and though there were some who questioned that, none did so within earshot of his lord. Within days of the knight's funeral, in which an empty coffin was buried with all honors, the matter was all but forgotten.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, Vogoth returned. But not as a man. As something foul and rotten. \r\n\r\nSomething in search of vengeance. \r\n\r\nNow, this blighted creature looms over his opponents, a towering slab of boil-encrusted meat. His cursed corpus is caught in a cycle of eternal decay, never fully rotting away, ever-expanding with unhallowed miasmas that vent from his ruptured skin with every swing of his rusty halberd. His once-handsome features are now a swollen mass hidden beneath a beatific helm, and his armor is a clattering mass of warped plates and broken straps, barely able to contain his bloated physique. The courageous battle-cries that once escaped his lips are now little more than gurgling groans, and he marches not for honor or glory, but to bring pain to the living. \r\n\r\nVogoth has been destroyed more than once, often by knights of Kaerok or warriors of the Sacred Order. But within a fortnight of any defeat, he rises once more from the pestilent marshes where he died, eager to resume his unending war on the living. \r\n\r\nIf there is a way of permanently ending Vogoth's cursed existence, no one has yet discovered it. And until someone does, Vogoth will continue to wage war on those whom he once sought to protect.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4970#static": "Some are born to privilege, some earn it. Some attain greatness by force of arms, others by wisdom. Certain heroes were simply in the right place at the right time. Sometimes all it takes to achieve renown is luck, and then to parlay that good fortune into a long and successful career. But it is rare for good luck alone to be the force driving one’s greatness, consistently, throughout many perils and trials. After all, luck is fickle… for most.\r\n\r\nCillian was a squire in service to a knight of Kaerok called Guelgach. His master was loved and respected, and Cillian hoped to one day match the knight’s chivalric greatness. But he was not suited for the role. More at home feasting and carousing than jousting and warring, he tried and tried to master the disciplines of knighthood, but fell short with every attempt. His swordplay was lackluster, his archery a menace to friend and foe alike, and his horsemanship was that of a drunkard even when he was sober. He never gave up, even though his master and the rest of his entourage would rather he did.\r\n\r\nOne day, while visiting the port city of Delanos, Cillian attended a banquet with his lord, but was ordered to leave when he accidentally spilled wine on a noted patrician. He wandered broodingly through the docklands, wondering if it was finally time to give up his dreams of knighthood. After a while he came upon a ‘ship’ the likes of which he had never seen: it was a living creature, a massive turtle, and on its back was a patch of forest growing on a crust of turf adhered to the ancient reptile. Asking the attendants at the gangplank, he learned it was a beast-craft of the Sylvan Watchers. Aflame with curiosity but denied a tour by the insular Sylvans, he experienced a rare alignment of strong desire and momentary competence, and managed to sneak aboard anyway. He entered the cultivated glade on the turtle’s back, marveling at the strange and beautiful foliage that only the Sylvan could produce. \r\n\r\nIn the center of the wood, a Fae, a spirit guardian of the vessel, appeared before Cillian. He had never heard of the Fae, nor their general mischievous nature. Guileless, Cillian greeted the creature, and the Fae asked Cillian why he had come and what he sought. It quickly became apparent that Cillian was a simple soul. He readily confessed his failures and bad luck. He told the Fae of his dreams of glory, and the glowing, tittering being simply chuckled. It promised Cillian a blessing for being so honest, and then leapt into the tree canopy and vanished amid the foliage. Cillian stumbled off the turtle-ship amazed, keeping the encounter a secret.\r\n\r\nCillian rapidly became one of Guelgach’s greatest assets. When sent to do mundane paperwork, Cillian always seemed to find the documents and tools he needed in the first place he looked. While Cillian accompanied the knight, misfortunes would strike others nearby, but always avoided Cillian and his master. Wild coincidences converged whenever Cillian attempted a feat he was previously incapable of. A sudden bit of pollen up his nose caused him to sneeze while holding a bow at full draw, and he let go only for the arrow to strike true and hit the bullseye. When he sparred, his swordplay little less clumsy than ever, but his opponents would stumble and trip so that his blows landed regardless. In a joust, his opponent’s lance would splinter or their horse would throw a shoe, letting even Cillian’s mediocre skill prevail. Gradually Cillian realized that the Fae’s blessing was real: his newfound luck was truly supernatural.\r\n\r\nCillian's growing number of successes made him a sensation of the court, and was given more responsibility. But the more he benefited from this power, the more he realized its drawbacks. His good fortune was not manifesting within him, it was being hoarded, drained from others around. What counted as a stroke of good luck for himself amounted to disastrously bad luck for someone else – usually a foe or rival, but sometimes innocent strangers nearby. Though Cillian was now respected and entrusted with important jobs, just as he had always dreamed, his triumphs felt hollow and he was pricked by guilt knowing his success came at the expense of others.\r\n\r\nMore responsibilities led to greater scrutiny of Cillian, Guelgach and his advisors suspecting something strange was afoot. So the blessed man confessed what had happened. Cillian testified that luck alone was not enough to be worthy of service. He then departed on a self-imposed quest, staying away from others to avoid stealing their luck, attempting to reach the Mistwood where the Sylvan dwelt so he could give the Fae its luck back.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4980#static": "Saito was once the captain of the guard of Shoji Bao, a great warlord from one of the easternmost of the Lost Isles. Zealous and diligent in his duties, Saito might have happily lived out his life as a warrior without peer among the peoples of the Isles were it not for Shoji’s jealousy towards Saito’s martial talents, and his mistaken belief that Saito had designs on his daughter.\r\n\r\nShoji arranged to have Saito assassinated. While Shoji’s daughter had indeed fallen deeply in love with him, Saito had no intention of dishonoring his role as captain of the guard by eloping with his warlord’s daughter. Shoji lured him into the Forest of Razors before leaving him to face a dozen picked ninjatu killers, each one a ruthless and experienced fighter.\r\n\r\nSaito met the betrayal with fury. By the battle’s end, twelve decapitated ninjatu lay around him. Yet he himself had been grievously wounded, and knew he would not be leaving the Forest of Razors alive. With his dying breath, he sent up a plea, that he would not be left to die alone and unremembered, his name tarnished by whatever lies Shoji was at that moment telling about his disappearance.\r\n\r\nSomething answered, though the outcome was perhaps not what Saito truly wished for. As the bitter chill of death gripped him, he felt himself able to stand, his strength returning. He found that it only threatened to leave him once more if he returned his twin katanas to their scabbards. As long as at least one of them was in his grip, though, it seemed that death itself now feared to claim him.\r\n\r\nSaito returned to Shoji’s clifftop castle, fully intending to take revenge on the treacherous warlord. When he made himself known, all were shocked by his appearance, none more so than Shoji. But despite her father’s duplicity being laid bare, Shoji’s daughter begged Saito not to slay him. Shoji’s guards refused to raise their weapons against their former captain and, after a long battle of emotions, Saito simply turned and stalked from Shoji’s stronghold, saying nothing more. The warlord’s reign soon ended, his authority unraveling as his treachery was exposed. By then, Saito was far away.\r\n\r\nThe former captain of the guard wandered the Lost Isles for many years, the figure of the dire, armored warrior transmuting into a legend told by pirates and fishermen. For a long time he appeared neither benign nor malicious, but would intervene when it seemed as though betrayal or dishonor were about to run their course. Be it humble ports beset by piratical thieves, or merchant expeditions trapped in the sweltering jungle and beset by Lizardmen raiders, Saito would appear unannounced, slay the attackers, and disappear just as quickly, seeking neither favor nor boon.\r\n\r\nIf indeed Saito merely wished to uphold his honor in Undeath, over time that noble intention warped. Burdened by immortality, exposed to the necromantic magics that kept his body from fully dying, Saito’s will hardened into something cold and unyielding. He began to associate weakness with dishonor, helplessness with cowardice. He came to not only slay the aggressor, but sometimes likewise those he might once have aided, regarding them as pathetic. He also grew less reclusive, even putting the necromantic powers that coursed through him to use on occasion, raising up a retinue of Undead warriors from the rain-swept jungles and lonely, shipwrecked coves.\r\n\r\nSaito is never seen without his ornate heavy armor and, of course, his twin katanas, which now appear to burn with the golden soul-fires of those he has slain. At his belt hangs the leering death mask that was once his badge of rank as captain of the guard, though he rarely dons it now, keeping it only as a memento of a past life while going into battle with his pallid features exposed. He fights with cold and fearless precision, a whirlwind of razor-edged death in which he can decapitate scores of foes in mere minutes or carve apart even the most fearsome beast or monster. Only when the killing is done does Saito lower his wicked blades, and even then, he never sheathes them.\r\n\r\nIt is unknown if Saito will ever be able to rediscover a balance between mercy, justice, and cruelty. Perhaps his will shall remain forever cold and deadly, like the swords in his fists. The fact that he is never seen without them has led some to claim that he cannot relinquish his katanas even if he wished to, and so is doomed to forever wander Teleria, while others believe that he can only release the weapons once he has slain a worthy foe or attained some kind of inner peace. Whatever the truth, the legend of Saito will undoubtedly continue for many ages yet.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=4990#static": "The future is never certain. None can know with certainty what could have been if one path were chosen by an individual over another, but it is possible to imagine an existence where Teleria’s greatest warriors were instead its most terrible despoilers.\r\n\r\nElhain is one such hero. An Elven noblewoman of Aravia, she benefited from all the advantages of her station – a complete education in both scholarly and martial arts, and being told in no uncertain terms that she was superior to the many other peoples who inhabited Teleria.\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude is not uncommon among the High Elves, but it is a seed that in some bears dark fruits. While Elhain became a hero of the Light, what would have become of her had she allowed her sense of superiority to lead her down a different path? If she met her match, might it have cut to the very core of her being?\r\n\r\nIt was during the Conclaves of the Elves that Elhain encountered a Dark Elf who seemed every bit as knowledgeable and capable as she was. Named Kael, he matched Elhain during both the negotiations and the competitions that acted as interludes between talks. Elhain became intrigued by Kael, but what would have happened if she had treated her first defeat at the Dark Elf’s hands as a personal affront?\r\n\r\nUnable to accept that she had come off second-best, Elhain might have convinced herself that her rival had used dark magics to gain an edge. Kael’s supposed evil and duplicity seemed to be confirmed when he was later involved in an attempt to assassinate Queen Eva of Aravia. After he escaped, Elhain seized the opportunity for revenge and swore before her ruler that she would track down and slay the would-be regicide.\r\n\r\nSo began Elhain’s hunt. She sought Kael first in Durham, but after several vicious encounters, was no closer to slaying him. Frustrated beyond reason, Elhain searched for something that would give her the advantage. She dabbled in the same dark magics she believed her rival was using, becoming obsessive.\r\n\r\nElhain began to strike dark bargains, communing with Demonspawn and making oaths no true High Elf should ever have countenanced. One particular deal saw her surrender a fragment of her soul in exchange for a rime-coated bow whose arrows could pierce the very spirits of its targets. As her hunt stretched into decades, she finally made the most terrible deal. She realized that she needed power and longevity if she was to finally bring Kael to heel. Seeing little other choice, she embraced Undeath and through it, gave fealty to the Shadow God. In her arrogance, she believed such taint would not corrupt her. It was a tool only.\r\n\r\nElhain eventually succeeded in her quest. Without need for sleep or sustenance, she tracked down Kael and ended him with an arrow. Only as he fell did Elhain appreciate the depth of what she had done. Victory had become her sole reason for existence, and now that it had been won, nothing else remained.\r\n\r\nFilled with dark ennui, Elhain might have ended her own existence over the body of her foe, but her own arrogance stopped her. She had merely done what needed to be done, or so she told herself. Siroth soothed her anguish and fed her convictions. He suggested she show everyone how much she had sacrificed, and the true extent of the superiority she had attained. She turned back for Aravia. \r\n\r\nIt is fortunate indeed for the people of the High Elf nation that these events never occurred.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5000#static": "There are many societies, fraternities, and knightly orders within Kaerok, most of which were founded by nobles and the wealthy in their seeking of status and alliances. Many of these chivalric organizations are martial forces in name only, focused more on courtly ideals or the relatively tame fighting involved in jousting and tournaments. But one society takes its martial traditions very seriously, swearing to do battle in defense of Kaerok and abandoning all else but their duty.\r\n\r\nFormed, in part, to defend and propagate the faith of Lumaya across Teleria, the Legion is a monastic warrior cult. In this sense, it is tied closely to the Sacred Order, but stands independent of their authority. It answers to Kaerok, though none could say exactly what would happen if the Sacred Order and the Banner Lords ever came into conflict.\r\n\r\nThose who join the Legion leave their old lives behind. They swear to kindle a flame for Lumaya and keep its light strong, and in so doing, give up any wealth or possessions they might own, and greater still, their very identity. Any names or titles they possess are relinquished along with all ties to friends and family. Instead they must find kinship among their Legionary brothers and sisters. These rules are strictly obeyed, and no favor is made to those of noble descent. \r\n\r\nTraditionally, such vows of poverty and discipline have proven popular among the commoners and peasantry who tended to fill the Legion’s ranks. Increasingly though, higher-ranking knights have forsaken their privilege to become a part of the Legion. These include a man formerly known as Sir Baderock, a figure who exemplifies the Legion’s ethos.\r\n\r\nBaderock’s family possessed a broadsword said to have been wielded by the man who had inspired the creation of the Church of Lumaya, and had once burned with holy fire, though most believed this origin story to be a fable, as there appeared to be nothing remarkable about the weapon. At least, not until the day a dark sorcerer attempted to open a dormant portal to Anathraad on Baderock's land.\r\n\r\nBaderock had been performing duties in the king’s court, and on returning found his home in ruins and the corpses of servants everywhere. Following a spiral of swirling dark energies to its center, he made out the figure of the sorcerer at work in the darkness. With a prayer to Lumaya on his lips, Baderock drew his fabled blade and approached the cursed wizard. His eyes widened with awe as holy fire suddenly blazed along the sword's length. He felt blessed. Invincible. He charged the sorcerer, roaring Lumaya's name.\r\n\r\nIn short order, the sorcerer was dead, his magics dying with him.\r\n\r\nOn returning to his manor, Baderock found his family had been killed by the sorcerer’s work. Though he thought he would rebuild, he knew without them he was directionless, his only solace prayer to Lumaya with his sacred sword in hand. When a party of the Legion came to his land, having had reports of smoke and dark magic, he readily swore himself to the fraternity, leaving behind everything but the clothes on his back and the weapon of his forebears, which the Legionaries soon deemed a symbol of Lumaya’s favor. \r\n\r\nSince that day Baderock has embraced his anonymity, concealing his face and entering battle wearing only simple mail and leather armor. He fights with the passion of a man who has nothing to lose, and believes every blow he strikes is a victory for a holy cause.",

No power was left unscathed, even those that tried to avoid the conflict between the Gaellen Pact and the Telerian League. The war was eventually decided by the League’s invasion of the Sorrowlakes, in which they pushed the Gaellen Pact back to their capital – the City of Dreams. Leading that force was the greatest commander of the Gaellen War: Princess Scyl of Frostheim. From an early age, the princess learned the lessons of war – both the horror and necessity of it.\r\n\r\nPrincess Scyl faced tremendous opposition, and not only from the Gaellen Pact. Leading a diverse alliance from across Teleria brought its own difficulties. Her army consisted of High Elves from Aravia, the Banner Lords of Kaerok, her own Confederation of Frostheim, and the Sacred Order – each with their own military hierarchies. While many argued for territorial gains, she alone realized that the key to ending the war stood at eliminating the Pact’s leadership. It took Scyl all her military experience and skills at diplomacy to convince her bickering allies.\r\n\r\nDespite the strength of the League, the Gaellen Pact made the Princess fight for every inch of ground. Lizardmen ambushed her ships on the rivers, tortured Skinwalkers fought ferociously for their very existence, and burly Orc and Ogryn forces punished the League at every turn. Above all those threats, Princess Scyl had to contend with none other than Rhazin Scarhide – Peacemaker, Founder of the Gaellen Pact, Clan Lord of Dreams, Last of the Warclave, and greatest Drake breeder in all the Sorrowlakes.\r\n\r\nScyl’s campaign against Rhazin went down in history, earning the princess her own sobriquet. Proud warriors throughout Anhelt sing of the deeds of Scyl of the Drakes, celebrating her heroism and sacrifice. Their favorite part is the climactic battle at the City of Dreams, where Princess Scyl fought Rhazin Scarhide himself at the City of Dreams’ heart, the high temple. Truly, the story is a grand demonstration of the might and power of the Telerian League... except those tales are always incomplete. Nobody can agree on the nature of Scyl and Rhazin's duel, or even who won. Some say Scyl drove her blade through the lizard's heart. Others claim the two killed each other, while still others believe that Rhazin bested Scyl and fled into the night, his grand city burning to ashes behind him. To this day, their fate remains unknown.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, as always, elusive and complex, and perhaps not the story that a drunken knight of the League would be proud to sing of at all. The greatest tragedy is how few know what really happened, and how much the truth might change the world…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5020#static": "Outside of the Sorrowlakes, Arnoc has the largest remaining enclave of Lizardmen, most living within the cavernous, labyrinthine sewers beneath the streets of the Free City. Within those pungent warrens, the Cult of the Skullsworn holds great sway over their kind. The most popular non-Lumayan sect among the Lizardmen, these cultists don the skulls of their ancestors, believing that the spirits of the lost grant them supernatural speed and ferocity. It is unclear if the Skullsworn truly benefit from magic or are merely fanatical, even to themselves. Regardless of the truth, in the bedlam of Arnoc’s sewers, every advantage makes a difference in the battle for survival.\r\n\r\nWhile the Skullsworn have no defined hierarchy, the skull each wears is tied to an ancestral lineage. Some of these are ancient, and the older or more storied the skull, the more powerful the spirits within it are supposed to be. None of the Skullsworn have as storied or ancient a skull as the one Skull Lord Var-Gall, the leader of the cult, possesses.\r\n\r\nVar-Gall does not live in Arnoc proper, but a few miles upriver on the shores of Lake Durham. He has lived there ever since he took up his title of Skull Lord, in the same cave as all his predecessors have for centuries. The skull too is centuries old, that of a Dragonkin suzerain, one who is said to have ruled over Arnoc back in the Gray Age, over a thousand years ago. This ancient ruler was once a mage-lord, and the words and runes of some of his spells have been etched onto the skull, granting strength and magical power to the one who bears it. This Dragonkin skull has been passed down since before the Cult of the Skullsworn itself was founded. The previous Skull Lord granted it to Var-Gall on her deathbed, for he had impressed her with years of devotion, knowledge of the cult’s history, and fighting skill.\r\n\r\nThere are oaths that bind the Skull Lord to the skull they wear and to the cult they lead and serve, but only Var-Gall knows them, and the only one who will learn them from him is whoever replaces him. Whatever these oaths are, they keep him out of the petty politics of Arnoc's sewer gangs, and even limit his direct involvement with the Skullsworn. Supplicants from the Cult will come to him for advice, arbitration on disputes, or training, which Var-Gall provides without fail – again in line with his oaths. Otherwise, Var-Gall lives a quiet life of contemplation, often fishing, the intricacies of which he sees as a metaphor for living a good life. \r\n\r\nWhen danger comes to the Skullsworn, however – when monsters creep up from the undersewers, or when Sacred Order crusaders descend into them purge them of ‘undesirables’ and ‘blasphemous creatures’ – the Skull Lord will come. He stalks the tunnels of Arnoc like they were his own, butchering any who attack his people. He can rip straight through plate armor or inches-thick carapace with his frenzied strikes, and the barbs on his skin will wither and poison any who are pierced by them, infecting their bodies with foul magic. That same dark power will draw his faithful Skullsworn back to him – even restore the wounded to health – lending the Skull Lord near-infinite reinforcements in every fight. Most foes flee before Var-Gall’s power before long... but few live to get that chance.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Order is convinced that the Skullsworn are necromancers, worshiping bones like the cults of Narbuk once did. The magic of the Skull Lord’s Dragonkin crown is the strongest evidence they possess. Unfortunately for them, any justice they might mete out will have to wait – first, they have to capture him, and he has little interest in the Sacred Order's hospitality.",

Earnest and dutiful, from a young age Hellmut assisted, working as a scroll-carrier. He dreamed of one day finding a way to end their hardships.\r\n\r\nGrowing up, Hellmut too became a scribe, working in the famed Bibliotheque Spire, and was hired by the then-archmage of Kaerok, Dalmar Witt, who wished to transcribe the intricacies of many of his greatest spells onto parchment. Hellmut was commanded to assist in this, and Witt sensed that the youth had latent magical ability.\r\n\r\nWitt took Hellmut on as his apprentice, though Hellmut insisted that all his payments be sent to his parents. To Witt’s fascination, Hellmut seemed particularly adept at the rare form of the magic related to the passage of time: chronomancy. It was a difficult art to master, but with a great deal of studiousness and care Hellmut learned to slow motion, reducing the speed of a falling stone or accelerating the blooming of a flower. He started using these skills to a small degree while helping his family, distorting the flow of time to complete more chores in a given day. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Hellmut, Witt passed away before he could complete his protégé’s training, but in his will, he raised Hellmut out of his apprenticeship. The newly-ordained mage decided that he needed to truly master the lessons he had been taught, knowing that by attaining his full power he could raise his family out of their destitution.\r\n\r\nHe set out across Teleria, seeking to advance his knowledge and abilities by studying ancient sites and delving into old libraries. Hellmut discovered a star-metal mace in an ancient tomb, which he ensorcelled to act as a locus for his chronomancy. He also created a ‘time closet’ where he was able to secrete himself away from not only the rest of Teleria, but the mortal plane of existence itself, to study the mass of materials he had collected for many decades, while in Teleria barely a year passed.\r\n\r\nWhen Hellmut returned to Kaerok, he found the first castle he arrived under attack by Orcs, and intervened immediately. The defenders had sallied out, and were faring poorly. One man, in the fine armor of a lord, was moments from being hacked to death by an Orc chieftain. Hellmut froze the Orc in time long enough for the lord's bodyguard to kill her, and within an hour the Orcs were driven away. The grateful lord took Hellmut to the king. Before the Knight of Knights' eyes, Hellmut froze a pair of hawks in mid-flight and then caused the wax from an array of candles to run in reverse, rebuilding them even as they burned.\r\n\r\nSuch a demonstration was of interest to the king, but did not seal Hellmut a position. Over the coming months he demonstrated the full extent of his abilities, translating a number of ancient Dwarf runic tablets in Kaerok’s archives, reversing the age of the king’s most prized racing stallion, and turning the court’s council chamber into a time closet, so meetings there could continue for hours while only a few minutes passed beyond its walls. \r\n\r\nHellmut’s sustained efforts saw the king grant him the title of archmage. He moved his parents and brother into the lavish tower that acts as the archmage’s home and ensured they would never have to labor or worry ever again. With his family now secure, he set out to safeguard not only them, but the whole of Kaerok. After using time’s trickery to see so much of the world, he was acutely aware of the fragility of the Human kingdom in the face of the brawn of Orcs and Ogryn, the arrogance of the Elves and the malevolence of Demonspawn.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5080#static": "Urost the Soulcage was born in the fecund horrors of the Bilebog, a bleak expanse of mire found near the eastern coast of Anhelt. Becoming a petty dabbler in dark magics early in his adult life, Urost was seized by an inquisitor passing through his home village, but managed to escape. Panicking, Urost knew that fleeing into the Bilebog meant almost certain death, but fancied it a better fate than the flames of the inquisitor’s pyre. Into the marshes he went, and was never heard from again, at least in his Human form.\r\n\r\nWhat unspeakable things occurred to Urost within the Bilebog remains unknown. The dismal swamp was said to have grown over the sight of an ancient battle between Elves and Demonspawn. The slaughter was so great, and the powers unleashed so intense, that over time the marshland developed a sentience of its own, albeit one trapped to the bounds of the former battlefield. In Urost, however, it discovered the possibility of escape. \r\n\r\nOnce the being that had formerly been known as Urost reemerged from the marshes, he was unrecognizable. The spirit of the Bilebog itself had entered into him, overwhelming both his body and soul and poisoning him with its festering evil. At last, the sentience of the accursed place had found a way to break the bounds of its own imprisonment and spread itself far and wide, using the subverted agency of Urost’s soul.\r\n\r\nUrost was imprisoned within the Soulcage, a frame formed from the loamy bedrock, the gnarled, worm-gnawed roots, and the stinking ooze of the marshes. Trapped in unspeakable agony, his physical body and infected soul acted as the vessel for the Bilebog’s parasitic sentience. Shambling and stomping out, he made for his home, terrified and desperate. His former friends and fellow-villagers fled before him in horror. He wandered the moors and the hills, wracked with pain, unconsciously spreading the poison of the marshes and causing the Bilebog to break its borders and expand.\r\n\r\nNews of the ‘Monster of the Bilebog’ spread, and the same inquisitor who had first chased off Urost returned to destroy the beast. In the battle that followed, the inquisitor’s followers were rotted down to mulch by Urost’s toxic miasma, or had their bones smashed and flesh pulverized by his great fists. The inquisitor was snatched up and consumed in the dripping maw-hole of the horror. In that moment, Urost knew release - his spirit was freed to disappear into Teleria’s leylines, his place within the Soulcage taken by the shrieking inquisitor’s soul. Now it was his turn to endure as the Bilebog’s vessel.\r\n\r\nThose not learned in the dark magics that had given birth to the Bilebog’s sentience knew nothing of the exchange of souls. To those who had heard of the monster’s legend, it was still Urost, the poor fool who had dabbled in the arcane and paid the price. So the name of the creature remained, even as the being at its heart changed.\r\n\r\nWhoever is imprisoned within the Soulcage, their goal remains the same. Tortured by the agony of the Bilebog’s poisons, they must seek out and consume another soul, praying that it takes their place within the rank prison. Not all souls are created equal, at least not as far as the spirit of the Bilebog is concerned. The one devoured must be considered worthy by the wicked marshland spirit, or the original prisoner’s sentence will continue. Because of this, the thing commonly known as Urost typically seeks out great heroes and warriors, and will stop at nothing to consume them. In this, Urost is aided by its near-invulnerability, its root-bones and muck-flesh reknitting after each blow. The poisons which suffuse it are lethal, and can be unleashed not only to wreak further mayhem, but to allow Urost to experience a moment’s catharsis, when it shares its pain with others.\r\n\r\nIn their delusions, some individuals trapped within the Soulcage seek out dark magicians and practitioners of Undead magics, believing they might hold the knowledge of their release. Such hope is a vain one, however. Many Undead allies have learned to use Urost’s desperation in their favor, forming alliances with the rancid creation. What some fail to realize is that, when their promises aren’t kept, Urost is as implacable hunting them down as it was when aiding them. \r\n\r\nWhenever Urost succeeds in devouring a worthy foe, the cycle begins anew, and the curse resets itself. And all the while, the swampy Bilebog itself continues to grow, the marshland’s bounds reaching out to turn fields rotten, make wells stagnant, and consume the villages and farms. If it remains unchecked, one day in the very distant future all of Anhelt may be reduced to a featureless, festering morass, and the evil at Urost’s heart will reign supreme.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5110#static": "Entertainment is hard to come by in the Dark Elf enclaves of Durham Forest. Gambling is among the most popular of pastimes, with wagering on pit fights being the most common sort. Every Dark Elf settlement, whether canopy-town or isolated village, has its pit. Some are small, barely large enough for one unlucky prisoner and whatever monstrosity they are being fed to. Others are larger structures, able to contain many dozens of combatants, whether Elf and otherwise. \r\n\r\nWhile most pit fights are between desperate prisoners and monsters captured in the depths of Durham Forest, there are those who choose the life of a pit fighter. Their reasons are varied; for some, it is the money that can be won, while others simply enjoy the thrill of combat. But for some, it is akin to a religious calling. \r\n\r\nVisix the Unbowed is one such gladiator. From a young age, she dreamt of spilling the blood of her opponents, and as she grew, these dreams became an almost ungovernable desire. She sought to satisfy this need by picking fights with her peers, or stalking the dangerous beasts that roamed the forest. Worried that her behavior might lead to her being injured or killed, her parents ensured that she received the finest training the wealth of a noble family could buy. She was even given the opportunity to dispatch the occasional criminal in sanctioned executions. But it was not enough for Visix. She chafed at her parents’ insistence on such controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nVisix demanded the chance to face a worthy opponent in the pits. Her parents, fearing for the loss of their heir as well as the embarrassment that said loss would bring, denied her, but Visix was adamant in her desire to taste real combat. She snuck out, and made her way to the local pit, where her arrogant manner quickly saw her ushered into combat with a monster unlike any she’d ever seen; a thing of segmented legs, venomous pincers, and a thorny carapace that was harder than iron. But rather than cowering in fear, Visix hurled herself gleefully into combat with the monster.\r\n\r\nThe battle that followed was like nothing Visix had ever experienced. The ugly creature was fast, strong, and relentless. The Dark Elf was pushed to her limits, and nearly killed, but nonetheless emerged triumphant. Her body battered and bruised, her flanged mace heavy with gore, Visix felt a deep sense of satisfaction settle on her as she stepped over the twitching carcass of her opponent. For the first time, she felt truly complete. It was a feeling she wished to experience again. Wanting a keepsake of the battle, she had a section of the creature’s chitin hollowed out and turned into a shield. \r\n\r\nSo began Visix’s gladiatorial career. Her parents, though angry at first, soon saw the benefits of Visix’s interests. They wagered heavily on her, and their wealth increased with her every victory. Their good fortune would come to an end, however.\r\n\r\nFor months, Visix had been rampaging through her local pits. While some of her bouts were more difficult than others, she never tasted defeat. But no matter how loudly the audience cheered, Visix felt nothing but dissatisfaction. Where was the thrill of that first great fight? Why could she not replicate it? She knew that other, greater challenges were out there waiting for her in the world. She just had to find them. Whether her parents agreed or not. \r\n\r\nThey did not. In fact, they attempted to prevent her departure by force. What truly occurred next is unknown, but popular gossip has it that Visix slaughtered the majority of her family’s household guard in a riot of violence. What is known is that she departed the next morning, covered in blood, smiling. \r\n\r\nSuch was Visix's fame that nobles and guild leaders alike from throughout Durham offered her exorbitant sums to patronize their fighting pits, in order to draw in wealthy gamblers from Velyzar and elsewhere with the promise of her skill. In return, Visix was promised her pick of worthy opponents, including massive monsters drawn from the depths of the forest,  captured Kaerok knights, or even the occasional Demonspawn. \r\n\r\nBut Visix refuses to face those she deems to be weak or unsuited to battle, and her insistence on never participating in rigged or unfair bouts has earned her many enemies. More than once, a would-be gangster has demanded that she throw a fight, only to find themselves and their guards on the receiving end of one of Visix’s rampages. Countless are the vengeance plots being made against her.\r\n\r\nFor Visix, the search for a truly worthy opponent has become akin to a holy quest. She refuses to rest until she meets someone, or something, strong enough to defeat her in battle…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5320#static": "The Gaellen War was at its bloody height when the creature that became known as Vergumkaar was conceived. The tide was turning against the forces of the Gaellen Pact, and in their desperation the Lizardmen turned to all manner of experiments in an effort to win the war.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of the conflict resulted in numerous trials that would not have been permitted previously. The spawn-handlers sought in particular to create creatures that were as intelligent as regular Lizardmen, but possessed a physicality that rendered them good beasts of burden and powerful warriors. They should also – unless roused for battle – be docile and unhesitating when it came to following orders.\r\n\r\nNumerous failed attempts caused most of the Gaellen Pact’s leadership to disregard the efforts of the experimenters, and when the forces of the Telerian League landed on the shores of Peltas, most efforts were abandoned. One spawn-handler named Itchakren, however, refused to give up on the possibility of breeding what he believed would be the perfect warrior. With a small number of faithful followers, he continued his efforts in an isolated Lizardman temple in the heart of the Sorrowlakes.\r\n\r\nThe war swept past, but the forces of the Telerian League never found Itchakren’s work, which had become more of an obsession to him than an effort to help the Pact to victory. After months of effort, he finally met with success. A creature was hatched from the spawning pools that bore all the desirable characteristics Itchakren sought: pliability; strength; thoughtfulness. He named the hulking, horned thing Vergumkaar, ‘the Future Great’ in his particular dialect. The great lizard possessed an intellect as strong as his tough, scaled body, and a wisdom that even Itchakren had not anticipated. Slow to anger, the creature nevertheless passed all the tests and challenges his creator set him, excelling in trials of strength and combat-ability, showing streaks of loyalty and protectiveness in particular.\r\n\r\nWhile all of Itchakren's further attempts at creating more beings like Vergumkaar met with failure, he seemed content that his life’s work had been ultimately successful. Rather than leading Vergumkaar to war – undoubtedly, even his great strength would not have been remotely enough to turn the tide by that point in favor of the Pact – Itchakren remained at his old temple, where he doted on Vergumkaar as though he were his own offspring. Years passed, and eventually Itchakren died. Knowing nothing of the world beyond the Sorrowlakes, Vergumkaar continued to occupy the temple that was his home until, one day, everything changed.\r\n\r\nLong after the Gaellen War had ended, an avaricious and powerful Banner Lord by the name of Baron Rodrik came to the Sorrowlakes seeking riches. He invaded Itchakren’s former temple, believing there was great wealth inside. Instead, what he found was Vergumkaar. The creature was docile at first, but when Rodrik, wanting its head and horns for a trophy, attacked it, something was triggered deep within Vergumkaar. The creature fought back, and a desperate battle ensued between them, a battle that only ended with the abrupt intervention of Rodrik’s cook, Ursuga. When Ursuga had still been a child, Rodrik had slain her desert tribe family and enslaved her. Only now, at long last, was Ursuga taking vengeance, ending Rodrik as he fought Vergumkaar by stabbing him with one of his own great drinking horns.\r\n\r\nVergumkaar could sense there was more to Ursuga than met the eye. Indeed, the thickset Human woman had saved his life. Ursuga lowered her weapon and spoke to the creature. Though unable to reply verbally, it showed her Itchakren’s old experimental chambers and helped her understand that he was a unique being. Ursuga was impressed, and with a bow of its head and a scrape of its claws Vergumkaar swore silently that he would follow Ursuga wherever she traveled. In that moment, the spawn of Itchakren found a new purpose.\r\n\r\nThe great lizard-spawn soon proved his value. He dragged Ursuga out of churning ice-rapids during a river crossing in the Kingdom of Frostheim, and drove off Orc bandits during their journeys through the Redspike Mountains, after detecting their covert approach upon the camp while Ursuga slumbered by the fireside. He easily carries the treasures Ursuga seized during their adventures and, at times, even acts as a mount in battle for the powerful warrior. Many assume Vergumkaar is a simple beast of burden, but in this regard they are wholly mistaken. His wit is as keen as Ursuga’s, perhaps more so, and the two use the bond they have forged down the years to deadly effect, Vergumkaar’s sharp senses and resilience, as well as his cunning, effectively offsetting Ursuga’s strength and at-times overweening determination. They are equals and, together, they have developed a reputation that might well live up to the meaning of Vergumkaar’s name.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5330#static": "After a long crusade, Baron Rodrik, a particularly wealthy and corrupt Banner Lord, decided to further expand his holdings by seizing a section of the Krokhan Desert rumored to be rich with gold. In truth it was only rich in dust, rocks, and scaled scuttle-crawlers, but Rodrik was a proud man, and he persisted with his mining efforts.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before those efforts drove Rodrik to conflict with some of the Krokhan’s nomadic peoples. He barred the Adwala tribe from passing through the land he claimed as his own, which was traditionally part of their ancestral hunting grounds. Believing they may have known the location of the gold, he demanded they tell him where he could find it. When they insisted they knew nothing, he flew into a rage and ordered them slain. A short, brutal battle followed, with Rodrik’s knights falling on the Nomads, slaying many and enslaving the survivors.\r\n\r\nUrsuga was among the latter. The child of the Adwala chieftain, her mother concealed her identity before she died, knowing her daughter's high standing would make her a target for the baron. Thinking that she was a mere serving girl, the daughter of the chieftain’s cook, the baron assigned her to work in his kitchens.\r\n\r\nUrsuga was clever for her age, and successfully concealed her identity. She grew up into a stout, strong woman, seemingly loyal to Rodrik, though in reality she harbored a burning desire to avenge her family and her people. With time, she became head cook to the baron, and she resisted the urge to use her high standing to her advantage. Poisoning Rodrik would not give her the same personal gratification as physically landing a killing blow, and make her too obvious a culprit. She also did not intend to merely take vengeance for the Adwala. Ursuga intended to survive for them too, and carry on their legacy. Her chance for vengeance and freedom eventually came when Rodrik grew bored of Krokhan and set his sights on the Sorrowlakes of Peltas. He took an expedition into that inhospitable realm, bringing Ursuga with him.\r\n\r\nRodrik’s expedition quickly encountered fierce opposition. When he discovered an ancient, half-ruined temple, he roused its Lizardmen guardians to action. A ferocious battle ensued, and the wayward Banner Lord discovered the reptilian warriors were a harder prospect than an unsuspecting caravan of desert Nomads. In the midst of the fierce fighting, Rodrik battled a hulking, scaled beast at the temple’s heart, striving to gain access to the relics he believed lay beyond. It seemed that the baron was on the cusp of triumphing, when Ursuga approached him from behind and struck him a ringing blow on the helm with a massive, gold-plated dinner dish he had insisted she bring with them. Stunned, Rodrik could do little when the roaring Ursuga then took up one of the great drinking horns he had also commanded be brought and punched its sharp tip through his throat.\r\n\r\nAs Ursuga’s cry of victory – one she had waited so long to utter – echoed through the embattled temple, she found herself staring into the yellow eyes of the hulking lizard beast Rodrik had been fighting. It made no aggressive moves towards her, seeming to appreciate that something momentous had just occurred and that Ursuga had no quarrel with it. If anything, something about its expression told Ursuga it believed it owed her its life.\r\n\r\nAs the Lizardmen slew the last of Rodrik’s warriors, the creature warded them off from harming Ursuga, and she realized that it was a being as sentient and intelligent as her. The Lizardmen agreed to let her depart and, to her surprise, the creature followed her. The Lizardmen called it ‘Vergumkaar’, and claimed it intended to honor its debt to her, and that she should in turn show it all respect.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth, Ursuga had a loyal companion. Reforging Rodrik’s platter into a great, golden shield, she has set out to find and free the scattered remnants of her old tribe who were sold into slavery. In doing so she has embarked on a lifetime of adventure across Teleria, and stories of the mighty woman, accompanied by an equally mighty beast, both draped in the treasures won during their escapades, have become legend.\r\n\r\nUrsuga periodically returns to the Krokhan Desert, Vergumkaar by her side. If she finds the Nomad tribes there beset by enemies of any kind, she rallies them and leads them in battle. To the peoples of the desert she is therefore not only a great adventurer, but a legendary defender of freedom and liberty. Woe betide any enemy of the Krokhan peoples when the cry of the Warcaller goes out, and the tribes rally behind her.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5340#static": "As the youngest daughter of an old king of Kaerok, Annie was used to getting her own way. Courtiers and nobles often spoke of her brattish volatility, though they did so privately and in hushed tones, as the king would brook no complaints about his favorite child. So, Annie’s misdemeanors went unchecked, and as she became a teenager, her arrogance and insolence only grew.\r\n\r\nOne day, Kaerok’s most famous toymaker, his name now long-forgotten, was putting the finishing touches on his greatest work yet: a life-sized doll he was making for his own daughter’s birthday. Annie learned of the project and, descending on the workshop accompanied by the royal guards, demanded the doll for herself. When the toymaker refused, the enraged teenager snatched up one of his tools and killed him with it.\r\n\r\nWhat Annie could not have known, however, was that the toymaker was more than he seemed. He was a secret practitioner of magical arts. As he lay dying, he gripped the leg of the doll with his bloodied hand and spat a terrible curse at the ruthless princess.\r\n\r\nThe effect was immediate. Annie’s body collapsed to the floor as her spirit was ripped from her mortal flesh and bound. Via the toymaker’s blood, it was transmuted into the shell of the doll, which in turn twisted as it took on part of Annie’s appearance, her face melding with that of the artificial construct. Wooden bones cracked and twisted as she pawed at herself in horror, clawing at the frozen, rictus mask that was now her face.\r\n\r\nAnnie’s guards hastily returned the shrieking doll-girl to her father, along with her now-lifeless former body, and the king sought by all means to break the curse. No cure could be found. Fearing the attention of the Sacred Order, he chose to hide his daughter away. Imprisonment for Annie was twofold – not only within the darkest dungeon cell, but in the unfeeling body of the doll, without the ability to taste, to touch or to smell. It drove Annie to madness, a madness that saw half of her family and the royal guards slaughtered before she made her escape.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Order, hearing of this abomination, sent one of its most ruthless purgation squads to track down and exterminate it. None returned. Legend has it that Annie made skin-puppets from their remains.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps no surprise that the tale of Annie has become one of the most infamous bedtime stories in all of Anhelt. Wayward children from Frostheim to Aravia are reminded of the curse that befell the girl who would not listen to her parents and wards, who was arrogant, greedy, and vengeful, rather than dutiful and merciful. Annie, Princess of Kaerok, became Little Miss Annie, to most a bedtime ghoul, and little more.\r\n\r\nBut there are those who know that Annie’s tale is no mere story, especially those who have dealings with the Undead. Little Miss Annie did indeed escape her father’s castle, and did indeed destroy those who pursued her. Ever since she has continued to seek out a way to break her curse, a way to end the unfeeling, stultifying existence forced upon her. Down the centuries, her cruel demeanor has become even more marked, turning her into a bitter, twisted creature who takes what she wants and expects every demand to be met, one whose only true delight is in the suffering of others.\r\n\r\nRightly believing the magic that infuses her is tied to the dark arts of necromancy, Annie suffers the kinship of other Undead only insomuch as she bullies them or forces them to aid her machinations, caring not if they are vampires, restless spirits, wight lords, or necromancers. She has discovered that despite being entrapped in an artificial construct, she is still able to learn and practice dark arcane spells. Her greatest delight was when she mastered the ability to raise the dead – now she had puppets of her own, ones ironically made from rotten flesh and moldering bone. Turning all those who defied her into deathly dolls dancing on the ends of her necromantic strings became a goal almost as central to her being as being as breaking the curse.\r\n\r\nWhether Little Miss Annie is bestriding battlefields amid an Undead horde, or stalking her prey alone through darkened alleyways or across desolate moorlands, her abilities remain unchanged. Unable to feel pain, and with spells that reknit broken stick-limbs or stuffing-gouged torso, she is almost impervious to damage – it is said she can only be slain by piercing the black magic at the core of her being, and even that is a myth. On the attack she is wickedly fast, and the blackened, bloody talons that sprout unnaturally from her gnarled fingertips can rend even the finest plate armor. She is a relentless sadist, cackling at the pathetic efforts of those trying to resist her, taunting them with promises concerning how she will make their bodies dance and contort, both while they are alive, and long after their death.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5350#static": "Narma the Returned is a senior Knight Revenant and one of the most feared not only among the Knights' enemies, but also among their own ranks. A long-standing member of the Cult of K’Leth, Narma quickly found rivalry in Sheleth, another well-established Knight Revenant who singled Narma out as a foe.\r\n\r\nFor her part, Narma thought Sheleth flagrant in her mocking abuse of her fellow K’Leth acolytes. Though Knights Revenant rarely have much regard for the lives of the cultists, Narma saw how Sheleth’s brazen distaste for her underlings caused discord in the lower ranks. As Narma saw it, there was a danger that the truth about the Cult of K’Leth – that no acolyte’s soul would ever be transferred into a new body – would be exposed, creating the very real possibility that the main body of cultists would rise up against their masters.\r\n\r\nIt was on this count that Narma challenged Sheleth and the two fought a well-matched duel through the catacombs of Narbuk. It was to be Sheleth’s victory. A talented practitioner of dark magics, she tore open a portal to the Crag of Despair, a far-flung rocky outcrop infested by Demonspawn in the Lost Isles. Narma was flung through the portal and Sheleth sealed it behind her, leaving Narma to be slain on the accursed isle.\r\n\r\nDecades passed, and Sheleth’s arrogance continued to damage the reputation of the Knights Revenant, with fewer petitioning to join the Cult. Senior members considered how they might constrain Sheleth but were too divided to conclude and take action. In the end though, they need not have concerned themselves.\r\n\r\nOne storm-wracked night at a sitting of the Revenant Council in the ruins of Narbuk, a figure arrived demanding entry. Sheleth was the name the stranger asked for, and the Knights who saw her knew her to be Narma, though she had changed. Her appearance had grown deathly pallid and wicked and her voice was as cold and cutting as the two poison-coated, razor-edged sickles she carried as weapons. The council looked on as Sheleth came forward and Narma demanded they duel once more.\r\n\r\nSheleth accepted, but had barely raised her blade when Narma cut her apart in a lithe assault. The score, Narma declared, had been settled.\r\n\r\nFrom that night onward Narma has been known as ‘The Returned’. She has never spoken of her time on the Crag of Despair, but its effect on her is clear – not only in her countenance but in her craving for pain and agony. Not only does she inflict pain on herself but she delights in inflicting it on others, including lesser K’Leth cultists. Theories to explain her pain-lust circulate among the Knights and their acolytes. If their constant transmutations leave Knights Revenant with dulling senses, perhaps Narma’s banishment has let her feel again, and she now craves the sensation of physical pain above all else? Others say that her freedom was bought at a cost and she must pay a demonic entity in errands of agony. Whatever the reason, a sub-faction of pain-worshipers has grown around Narma the Returned, and follows her acts of agony with twisted delight.\r\n\r\nNarma the Returned is also seen as an enforcer. Her deadly presence has been known to quell the excesses of some of those Knights who show too much arrogance or too great a disregard for the wider wellbeing of the Cult of K’Leth. Furthermore she intimidates and, where necessary, removes supposed allies of the movement who outgrow their usefulness, or begin spreading spurious accusations about what is really done with most soul gems.\r\n\r\nIn battle, Narma the Returned is a whirlwind of razor-sharp agony. With her dance-like fighting style she dodges and leaps around the blows of more cumbersome opponents, while she strikes with a speed most find impossible to follow, let alone defend against. She delights in torturing her foes before killing them, cutting hamstrings and tendons, lopping off fingers, severing arms and legs, mutilating faces, and slashing a thousand agonizing, toxin-laced gashes before delivering the final, killing blow. Most of those who know her choose to flee rather than face her on the battlefield, and those with the courage to face her know that should they plea for mercy they will be met only with cruel, mocking laughter.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5370#static": "The official chronicle of the Sacred Order positions the organization as wholly benevolent and just. According to its archives, its history is as pure as its duty to Lumaya – one that is free of scandal, corruption, or sedition. Anyone who has faced the terrifying zeal of a rogue Sacred Order purgation force would quarrel with this assessment. While many would point to any number of cruel and brutal recent incidents, there exists one tale in the Order's early history that suggests the turmoil within its ranks has existed longer than many realize. That is the tale of High Priestess Elegaius.\r\n\r\nA once pious priestess of the Sacred Order’s gleaming cathedral city, the Eternal Citadel, Elegaius became disillusioned with Lumaya. While Siroth's influence on the world was plain to see, the Arbiter and her Lightbringers seemed the only link Lumaya had left with the mortal world. There was no word from Lumaya despite all the Order’s adoring hymns, no sign of direct divine intervention from their loving deity, and no answer to their pleas. There was only suffering and pain as the followers of Siroth ran roughshod over each corner of the world. To Elegaius, Lumaya seemed to have abandoned her creation to the wolves. It was in this turmoil and despair that Siroth himself saw an opportunity.\r\n\r\nAll it took was a mysterious black mask, which Elegaius found deep within the Eternal Citadel's reliquary. It whispered to Elegaius, speaking the truth of the world, of Lumaya’s abandonment of Teleria, and that it knew how to claw back the attention of the Goddess. Elegaius listened to the mask's every poisoned word. It called for a grand choir – something with a voice loud enough to reach wherever Lumaya had sequestered herself. Elegaius would lead the body and use the power of its volume to interrogate the Goddess, who had left her creations to suffer.\r\n\r\nUsing her rank and title, Elegaius assembled a great mass within the depths of the Eternal Citadel, from where she knew its cacophonous song would feel as if it could reverberate across the whole world. Elegaius led the chorus in its singing of Lumaya's Light and Love. The congregation was brought to tears by the harmonies. It was then that the mask called out, begging Elegaius to wear it so they might call out to Lumaya together. After she donned the black mask, it bound itself to her face, and twisted into a horrifying visage. A great forked tongue lolled from its maw, while Elegaius’ voice grew guttural, strange, and eldritch. It became louder than the screams of the now horrified singers. It shook the very foundations of the Citadel, and the members of the choir writhed in agony. The melody had transformed into a hellish shriek, the force of it rending the very souls of its listeners from their bodies.\r\n\r\nA formless void manifested around Elegaius, drawing in the tortured souls of her choir. The earsplitting howl reached its crescendo until suddenly... there was silence. Elegaius' own body could not sustain the infernal magic and had collapsed, apparently now dead, under the weight of its power. But her corpse was not wholly inanimate. Where her life ended, her Undeath began. Leaving untold desecration behind her, Elegaius crawled away into the darkness before the Order discovered her sins, the souls of her damned choir trailing behind her. When priests and knights uncovered the devastation deep in the Eternal Citadel, and extracted confessions from the handful of survivors, they attempted to destroy all evidence of what happened. They then propagated word of a witch who had dared to breach the sanctity of the Citadel, who should be hunted down and watched for at all times.\r\n\r\nThat was long ago, but Elegaius is still said to haunt Teleria, gathering strength to one day complete her black mass. Together with her choir of damned souls, she still aims to finally tear through the bounds of creation, and demand an answer from her creator.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5510#static": "Clad in ornate armor of gold, hoarfrost, and black steel, Yakarl strides through the field of battle like an ice giant. He is a living legend, a warrior from the days when Norr raiders sailed across the ocean from the Winterlands and struck terror into the hearts of all they encountered. The runes tattooed upon his body and etched into his ax glow with the glory of his past, yet he now serves a higher power.\r\n\r\nYakarl was once a mighty warlord, ruling a prosperous Winterlands port in the final days of the Gray Age. When the Sin of Dragons was committed and the First Great War began, Yakarl cared little for Ramantu Drakesblood's pleas for the people of Teleria to unite against the predation of Siroth. Instead, he saw the fall of the Empire of Dragons, and the death of Basileus Roanas, as the perfect opportunity to prey upon the isolated Dragonkin colonies and the weakened Elf Kingdom of Aravia. His ships scoured the coastlines of any wealth and slaves they could carry, and easily overwhelmed those who tried to stop them. Yakarl sent home enough riches to forge a kingdom in the Winterlands that could have one day rivaled Aravia itself. But it was not to be.\r\n\r\nOver his years of pillaging, Yakarl had left trusted jarls in control of his holdings. From their perspective, Yakarl was a wonderful king – his ships brought home great wealth, and he was not around to spend it or hold those responsible for it accountable. The jarls’ greed blossomed, as did their boredom with no enemy to fight. Families waged political wars instead for land, coin, and slaves, and when Yakarl finally returned, he found his realm buried in plots and discontent. Rivals challenged his rule, or attempted to break away to form their own fiefdoms. Yakarl was a great conqueror, but a poor politician, and a year after his return, he had failed to settle the myriad disputes and threats. He had never sought civil war, seeing disunity as a way to shatter his nascent realm, but he realized that to keep his crown, he had to turn his wrath against his own people.\r\n\r\nYakarl was furious but, deep down, he knew that his rage was a symptom of his despair. He had thought himself wiser and stronger than the fools who had marched off to die in the First Great War.\r\n\r\nDesperate for a peaceful solution, Yakarl the Scourge approached his sages. Most were unable to help him, their words ambiguous, but one spoke of a power deep in the heart of the Winterlands that could grant him the might of the gods themselves. With such strength, he could unite his people once more. Yakarl gathered his most trusted huscarls and prepared an expedition inland. It meant leaving his territory unwatched once more, but he saw himself as having little choice. Besides, should this power be real, no challenge he faced upon his return would be insurmountable.\r\n\r\nThe expedition progressed well at first, but months of travel pushed Yakarl and his accompanying huscarls to the limit. One by one warriors perished, killed by rotten ice, falling into hidden crags, eaten by stalking beasts, or frozen. Yakarl saw his company melt away into the blizzards until he was all who remained. He was stronger than them all, and he marched on with pure grit and deep desperation driving him forward. Finally, he reached the shore of a pool of crystal clear water, steaming with heat even in the blistering cold. He thought he had come upon a footprint of a god. Instead, he had come upon one of their servants, who stood by the edge of the basin, as if waiting for him.\r\n\r\nIt was the Arbiter, though Yakarl did not know. Believing her an obstacle to the resource he had marched for so long to find, he challenged her to single combat, and she accepted. In the duel that followed, Yakarl was outclassed, despite all his ferocity and strength. After being disarmed and humiliated a dozen times, Yakarl yielded, asking only that she kill him quickly.\r\n\r\nInstead, the Arbiter revealed to Yakarl who she was and offered him a choice. She said he had abandoned her and all of Teleria during the First Great War, choosing instead to murder and steal, while heroes died to protect the world. Either Yakarl could die in punishment for his selfishness, or he could repent. By serving the Arbiter for eternity, he could redeem himself. The Arbiter spoke more, of the lands devastated by Siroth’s hordes, of all the death and horror they had inflicted. She called Yakarl a coward for not doing his part, and for attacking the weak, and incompetent for the failure of his kingdom. Thoroughly ashamed, he pledged his ax to her.",

It towers over its surroundings and extends into the heavens, and its slopes are surrounded by a haze of glittering, wind-blown frost, for which it earned its title. But on rare occasions, the clouds are clear and the winds die down, and when the sun shines upon the peak of Skybreach, there can be glimpsed a dazzlingly reflective pillar, a tower of pure ice that shines blindingly. Therein abides Pyxniel, the Peak’s Gaze, one of the most ancient and powerful sorceresses in the history of Teleria. Above even the clouds themselves, her mystic eye watches for encroaching Darkness.\r\n\r\nCenturies ago, during the First Great War between Lumaya and her Arbiter against the dread Darkness of Siroth, Pyxniel was an exalted archmage. She is said to have been friend, sometimes lover, of the heroic Basileus Roanas who was called the Great White Eagle. She defended the Arbiter’s Tower with staunch, bitter resolve against the fiery hordes of Demonspawn. She cut down scores with talons of frost and missiles of sharpened ice, and when the foe turned to flee they found their escape blocked by towering glacial walls. She produced blizzards to obscure the movement of troops and sow confusion in the enemy, following them up with waves of spectacular, lethal ice-darts. The Arbiter herself, watching Pyxniel and her disciples of ice magic, was impressed. \r\n\r\nAfter an era of strife and devastation, the war was won by the forces of Light. However, the worrisome truth was that the Arbiter and her forces had been pushed to nearly the breaking point, and she was in need of new sources of power and new tools to use against the immortal enemy, who she knew would inevitably attempt more invasions of Teleria. Seeing that Pyxniel possessed exceptional mastery of cryomancy that exceeded her own, the Arbiter approached Pyxniel personally and, to the shock of the frost mage, begged a favor: to tutor her in ice magic. Pyxniel was overjoyed and honored to serve the Goddess’ chosen, and agreed. They traveled to the Cloudspire Mountains, a place of bitter cold where they could shake the snows and blast epic gouts of elemental frost without fear of damaging civilization.\r\n\r\nThere, on the slopes of Skybreach, for months and months the two pushed each other’s talents to new heights. Not only destructive spells of war, but delicate and creative works as well were shared between the mortal and the envoy of Lumaya. The Arbiter learned to weave snow and ice into walls, spikes, pits, and even mechanisms. While Pyxniel slept and ate, the Arbiter relaxed by forming intricate sculptures from the glacial crust, the ice flowing at her command. Then it was back to drilling in martial cryomancy, unleashing frosty blasts and shaping lethal gelid blades, upheaving the snows to induce avalanches, and conjuring elemental servitors to assail a hypothetical enemy. Since Pyxniel was attuned to cold, she was largely immune to its ravages, and so made a perfect sparring partner for the Arbiter. Hillfolk and herdsmen a hundred miles away sometimes glimpsed the flashes of glittering rime and bursts of exploding snow created by their duels, and heard the distant rumble of their spellcraft borne on the freezing winds.\r\n\r\nEventually Pyxniel judged her pupil her equal in frost magic. As a final test and payment for her services, Pyxniel asked the Arbiter to raise a tower of ice, a copy of the Arbiter’s Tower which Pyxniel had defended so faithfully. Relishing the task, the Arbiter lovingly sculpted a gleaming white citadel atop the great mountain of their training. Her mentorship complete, Pyxniel now requested a final boon from the Arbiter. She wished to remain atop her new Tower to watch over the Cloudspire Mountains and even the distant Winterlands at the northern roof of the world. But she felt the pangs of age, and knew that her vigil would someday end in death. The Arbiter blessed the Tower of Skybreach so that Pyxniel would not age while she remained therein. In dire need the Elven mage can go forth to fight the Arbiter’s foes, and spend her precious coin of life, but for as long as she remains in her tower she serves as an eternal sentinel watching for danger on the horizon. Even as the Arbiter’s power has waned, her covenant with Pyxniel the Peak’s Gaze has held true. And should the need ever be dire, the Elven sorceress would gladly join the Arbiter forever in a Shard, just as her beloved Roanas did.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5550#static": "In the Dark Elves' continual web of internecine feuding, many of them have risen to undreamt heights of infamy, and few more so than Noct the Paralyzer. Noct began his career serving in the household guard of a noble family, but his callous disregard for life and his utter lack of discipline earned him few friends. For Noct, fighting was simply a means to an end; a way to indulge the sadistic tendencies that had been heretofore hidden within him, free of consequence.\r\n\r\nUnable to obey orders to the satisfaction of his betters, Noct soon found himself at loose ends. Few would employ him as a mercenary or bodyguard due to his generally unpleasant demeanor and unpredictable nature, and he had no liking for grubbing in the dirt as a fungus farmer. With few options open to him, Noct grudgingly took up the life of a Ranger. It was not a pleasant time, for the forest was wilder and fiercer than any Dark Elf truly knew, and had dangers aplenty, even for a seasoned killer like Noct. \r\n\r\nWary of traversing the treacherous forest paths, Noct often chose to travel via the canopy overhead. It was on one such journey that he met his match in a ravenous, hard-shelled insect matching his size, one of the innumerable species that inhabited the deepest reaches of the forest. It stalked him through the canopy, and was on him before he knew it.\r\n\r\nOnly Noct’s quick reflexes saved him from the creature’s scimitar-like pincers, but its weight carried them both from the high branches, down through the boughs and to the forest floor. They crashed through an ancient stone slab, and into the depths of what might have been a forgotten temple, reclaimed centuries earlier by the woodland. Dazed by the fall, Noct could only watch as his attacker scuttled towards him, intent on finishing what it had started.\r\n\r\nIt never reached him. A swarm of smaller insects, round and buzzing shapes that shone with emerald iridescence, attacked the creature, stinging it into motionlessness. Noct froze, instinctively understanding that to move was to die. He remained still, barely daring to breathe. The swarm hovered for a moment, then retreated into the darkness of the ruin, leaving Noct alive… and curious.\r\n\r\nNoct examined the larger insect and found to his surprise that it still lived, though it was paralyzed. He considered slaughtering it, but something made him hesitate. Instead, he retreated to a safe distance and waited. Soon, the swarm returned, in larger numbers. As Noct watched, they fed on their victim, eating it alive over several days.\r\n\r\nThere, Noct had an epiphany. He seized the opportunity to slay one of the creatures when it became separated from the swarm and carefully extracted its poison sacs. Dipping his wickedly curved blades into the poison, he set about testing his hypothesis on several unfortunate Rangers who happened across the ruin. After some trial and error, Noct realized that he could paralyze an opponent with the merest scratch from one of his knives, or with a well-placed thrust, deliver the poison to a target’s bloodstream and stop the heart, lungs, and brain in a matter of moments. Further experimentation revealed that varying the amounts could cause excruciating pain to a victim, rather than killing them, cause nightmare-filled sleep, or cause paralysis in specific body parts, such as the eyes, ears, or limbs.\r\n\r\nWith these experiments completed to his satisfaction, Noct decided the time had come to put his newfound knowledge to practical use. He scavenged bits of the insects’ kills to make himself a suit of armor, and took his pick of the gear left over from his own victims. After making note of the ruin’s location for his poison needs in the future, he departed, to return to the undergrowth-towns of his people. But not as a Ranger.\r\n\r\nInstead, Noct had decided to take up a new career: that of assassin. In the months that followed, Noct learned to utilize the venoms of dozens of insectoid species, and quickly established his reputation as a dealer of exquisitely painful deaths. Not satisfied with merely dispatching his targets, Noct tortures his victims as a warning to those who consider crossing his clients. He often leaves paralyzed victims for the insects in the forest, or entombs them alive. Others he simply incapacitates, leaving them to die in immense agony.\r\n\r\nStories of Noct's grisly exploits have swiftly spread throughout Durham Forest, and with them have come a surge of potential clients, vying his services.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5560#static": "While the underworld of Arnoc and the festering Sorrowlakes are the main hubs of the Lizardmen population, there are enclaves scattered across Teleria. One such clan survives in the Lost Isles, upon a jungle island that was formerly a Dragonkin stronghold. Now calling themselves the Speq'chaa, these Lizardmen were ancestor-revering isolationists. That was, until the spawning of Roxam.\r\n\r\nThe day of Roxam’s hatching was filled with portents. A blazing star was seen to fall from the skies into the ocean, and a volcanic eruption on the far horizon threw up a pall of ash and debris that settled over the jungle canopy. If these signs were not obvious enough, it was immediately apparent that Roxam was no ordinary hatchling. Bony nubs protruded from the little Lizardman’s brow, growths that in time became great, curved horns. His skin, naturally rainbow colored, could change so that he resembled the environment around him.\r\n\r\nConsidering this peculiarity, it was little surprise to the Speq’chaa’s elders when, at a young age, Roxam began to prophesy. At first his predictions were minor. He knew when the deluges that swept the island’s jungles would begin to fall, and he anticipated whether the fishing coracles would come back laden with fresh catches or bearing empty nets.\r\n\r\nLittle time passed before, at his own request, Roxam was accepted into the priesthood that administered the Speq’chaa’s spiritual needs. He soon spoke of a time of great change, one that would both threaten the clan’s existence and open possibilities for a new and glorious future. These prophecies were treated with great concern by the clan’s leadership, for it was said that Roxam – now known as the Horned Priest – had never been wrong. He had foreseen the outbreak of the Scale-rot, his warning ensuring the Speq’chaa prepare to face the hideous disease. The Great Mudslide, too, came of no surprise to the clan thanks to Roxam's talents, and not one life was lost.\r\n\r\nRoxam’s prediction came true one morning when lookouts on the island’s clifftops reported seeing a ship on the horizon. It was a great edifice of timber and canvas that dwarfed the tiny coracles that were the clan’s only means of seafaring. The Speq’chaa gathered themselves in fearful expectation, but on Roxam’s advice, they did not take up arms or try to resist the sailors when they landed. They were Humans, creatures that existed in the stories that persisted in the clan’s memories, of a time when they had been unified with Dragonkin.\r\n\r\nThe Humans were adventurers and merchants from the Kingdom of Kaerok, seeking fame and fortune in an exploration of the Lost Isles. Most had past dealings with Lizardmen but struggled to equate the miserable criminal gangs that infested the Free City of Arnoc with the proud Speq’chaa, who had succeeded in upholding some vestige of their imperial past. Of particular interest was the Speq’chaa’s gold, but the Lizardmen were too wise to give it over easily.\r\n\r\nDuring a debate with the clan’s elders, Roxam was able to convince them that they should send him forth with the Humans. There was a whole world waiting beyond the island – these visitors would certainly not be the last, and the Speq'chaa could not live in splendid isolation forever. For the sake of the clan, they had to know what was out there. The more they learned, the more ready they would be for when it came to them.\r\n\r\nThe plan was set: Roxam, the Horned Priest, was to journey out across Teleria as the Speq'chaa's emissary. He would learn all he could of the world and return with the knowledge to the clan, where his advice could help steer their future. In exchange for a number of gold trinkets, the Kaerok merchants agreed to give him passage on their return voyage. Roxam therefore traveled into Teleria, taking with him the headdress that acted as the Speq’chaa’s mark of priesthood, as well as his twin curved khopesh blades.\r\n\r\nUpon landing in Kaerok, Roxam traveled to Arnoc, sneaking in thanks to his chameleonic talents, where he discovered the thousands of Lizardmen who lived in poverty beneath the city. Their plight struck him hard, as did the fates of the clans that lived in the Sorrowlakes when he eventually reached Peltas. His visions caused him to believe that there was much the Speq’chaa could teach these peoples about dignity and unity. Throughout his journeys, Roxam dutifully noted all he learned, with the hope that when he returned to his island home, he would be able to convince more of the Speq’chaa to visit their distant cousins in Anhelt and Peltas.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Speq’chaa will be able to show their fellows on the mainland a society where they are neither downtrodden nor helpless, and remind them of a past when proud Lizardmen held in their palms the very destiny of the world.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5580#static": "Many Telerian people, accustomed to their feudal societies, might assume that the Orc known as King Garog is a ruler or warlord among his people, of some great Orc tribe or confederation and with many servants and warriors at his command. In this they would be mistaken. For most of Garog’s existence, he has been as far from the role of rule as it is possible to be. The title was in some senses ironic, though in others it is well earned, for in a way Garog is indeed a king – one of slaughter, battle, and butchery.\r\n\r\nBorn into an insular Orc tribe living near the Sorrowlakes, Garog’s life might have been an unremarkable one were his people not assailed by Lizardmen raiders while he was still young. Those not killed were swiftly and brutally enslaved, and Garog was among them. The Orc youth was separated from his parents and sold to traders in southern Peltas looking for fodder for the fighting pits there. Gladiatorial games earned big money in the Arena City of Velyzar and in the wider region, and Orcs were always in high demand for their strength and size.\r\n\r\nGarog was thrust into the fighting pits of Vengar, a miserable slum that had sprung up in Velyzar’s shadow. A scrawny youngling armed only with a rusty old ax he had been given, he would surely have perished there had not one of the older Orc gladiators, Gaxvold, decided to take the boy under his wing. Gaxvold was a legend of the fighting pits, and Garog’s association with him ensured that he not only survived his early encounters, but soon grew in both skill and stature.\r\n\r\nYears passed. Garog became a hulking brute of a warrior, muscular and scarred. He fought with uncompromising power in the ring, and showed little mercy, wielding his heavy butcher’s cleavers to deadly effect. His successes, like those of many of the more famous gladiators, earned him a title, in his case 'King of Vengar'. Despite his many victories, he always held onto the desire to one day escape, or win his freedom. Once outside, he intended to search Velyzar first for knowledge of what had become of his mother and father and, if there was no link to be found there, return to the Sorrowlakes to pursue the effort there.\r\n\r\nBy the time Garog reached the height of his power and popularity, Gaxvold was aging. The veteran gladiator hoped that his master would release him for the final years of his life, but instead a grand contest was organized, billed as the ‘Last Stand of Gaxvold the Gray.’ The old Orc was set against two dozen opponents at once, alone. While he fought with all his customary strength and skill, his fate was sealed. The crowd had come to see Gaxvold die, and die he did, having drenched the area in the blood of his opponents.\r\n\r\nGaxvold’s fellow gladiators were outraged by his treatment, and none more so than King Garog. Convinced now that he would never be able to earn his freedom, Garog instead fomented rebellion among his fellow slaves, convincing them that Gaxvold’s fate likely awaited them all, and secured a key to the arena’s gates from a sympathetic guard with a gladiator relative. During the next great set of games, instead of battling one-another as usual in the pitched battle that opened the contest, the gladiators rose up, slaying any of their masters they could reach before making their break for freedom. Very few made it, but Garog was among them, his great cleaving blades dripping with the blood of his master and Gaxvold’s.\r\n\r\nSome of the escaped gladiators remained together as a warband, and asked Garog to lead them, but he refused, stating that he had seen enough slaughter. In the future, he resolved only to fight if he had no other choice. Unfortunately, the life of a runaway gladiator ensured he would frequently find himself with no options other than violence.\r\n\r\nGarog set out alone, hoping to find his parents or, at the very least, discover what fate had befallen them. He traveled to the Sorrowlakes, then followed rumors to the Deadlands. Months became years, and Garog passed over the sea to Anhelt. He has always been hunted by the allies of his former masters, for the gladiatorial massacre he caused in Vengar had entered into legend, and King Garog was now seen as a dangerous threat to authority by some, and a freedom-fighting inspiration by others. But while Garog slays all those who try to catch him or impede him, he has no interest in becoming a figurehead. His quest remains to discover the fate of his loved ones, and he will pursue it to the very ends of Teleria if he has to.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5590#static": "Samar was a prince of Gloomdeep Hold, the youngest son of the Mountain King Duran. True to their name, the dour Dwarves of this Hold have held few prospects of joy for the future, and a never-ending list of grudges and jealousies. Seeking to win glory and reverse the malaise and stagnation that King Duran saw among his people and bemoaned, Samar’s elder brother Gnut departed on a quest when Samar was a child. Gnut, heir apparent to Gloomdeep, told his younger brother to keep the royal affairs in order and to await his triumphant return.\r\n\r\nGnut’s quest to slay the Fire Knight and claim its legendary treasure dragged on, and missives from the questing prince became more and more infrequent and sparsely detailed. Samar had grown to manhood waiting for his brother’s return, and became agitated. He petitioned Duran for leave to find Gnut, but the Mountain King forbade it. He feared the worst had befallen Gnut, and he swore he would not lose another son to the folly of adventure and greed. Even though Samar was motivated by concern and loyalty, not a desire for glory, he was denied all the same. \r\n\r\nIn his frustration, Samar consulted Underpriest Brogni, who some call mad and others call a prophet. Kneeling before the ancient, sallow-faced sage, he begged for guidance. But from Brogni’s withered lips came the same response: none should delve deeply into the darkened bowels of the mountains, not even for love of family, for only doom awaited. Samar quietly acceded and left the Underpriest, but his heart was filled with rage. He had hoped to gain license to disobey from the enigmatic sage, but found only more discouragement. Samar concluded that the naysayers, even his father, were feeble, feckless old men, unworthy of obedience. At that moment he committed to a quest of his own, to seek out his missing brother and break the shroud of fear that lingered over Gloomdeep Hold.\r\n\r\nBut Samar lacked the power to realize his ambition. He had received proper training in arms and was tutored in the disciplines of rulership, but without official support for his expedition, he was stymied.  He needed a catalyst for greatness, and he happened to know of one locked away in his father’s vaults. Underpriest Brogni had gained power and sagacity from an encounter with a mysterious thrumming crystal he found deep underground, or so the story went – it had aged him terribly, and evidently trapped him in a timeless reverie for hundreds of years. But it had given him magic and wisdom, and Samar was willing to pay any price to gain such insight. If the whisperings of the crystal could give him any clues about the decline of Gloomdeep or the fate of Gnut, he was willing to use it. Brogni had brought samples of the crystals back with him, which were swiftly sealed away for fear of the danger they might pose. Being a royal scion, Samar knew their location within his father’s treasure vaults, and had little trouble convincing the guards to let him examine them, claiming mere academic curiosity. The guards, used to Samar being meek and obedient, did not suspect his true aims.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was chaotic and poorly recorded. Servants, even at great remove from the treasure vault, heard horrific screams like none that had ever ripped from the throat of a healthy Dwarf, along with dreadful crackling and crunching. Then more screams echoed through the halls, first of surprise, and then terror and pain. By the time the disturbance was investigated, the guards who had let Samar pass were dead, bled out from stab wounds from a massive spike of some kind. Bloody boot-prints led away from the scene, only to peter out inconclusively. The Hold was locked down and a manhunt ensued, and whispers of madness striking Prince Samar escaped the palace and spread.\r\n\r\nHours later, another dire portent was reported: on the Hold’s outskirts appeared the dread fiery form of Acrizia, the Lost Daughter of the 36th. She, like Brogni, was a Dwarf who had been touched by something unnatural deep in the caverns, and now moved in shadow for some inscrutable purpose. The patrol that spotted her swore they saw another Dwarf following her, a Dwarf of fiendish silhouette, flickers of light from Acrizia’s burning sword glinting off the monstrous crystalline growths erupting from his flesh. Corroborating several reports, Duran ordered an artist to sketch a depiction based on eyewitness accounts, and when he saw the details of his son Samar emerge from the ink, half-buried in crystal corruption, he collapsed with despair.\r\n\r\nOld Underpriest Brogni, one of the last Dwarves to see Samar alive and wholesome, could only repeat his dire warnings with a sad, defeated air.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5600#static": "Uugo is a battle-summoner, a herald for a war that has long since been lost. Her abilities are linked to the Summoning Horn and the Great War Drum, twin artifacts of both symbolic and magical power that have taken on an almost mythical status among Ogryn down the centuries. Uugo knows the stories of her ancestors, and believes that a time will yet come when her magical instruments will help usher in a new age for Ogryn-kind, uniting the tribes and perhaps even forming a true Ogryn nation.\r\n\r\nIn the latter years of the Gaellen War, with Gaellen Pact forces struggling against the armies of the Telerian League, Pact sorcerers sought to win new recruits by uniting the Ogryn tribes dwelling outside the Sorrowlakes and driving them to war in their favor. Besides emissaries and entreaties, they created a number of magical artifacts, instruments imbued with arcane energies that could speak to the tribal heart of many Ogryn. These instruments accompanied the Pact’s messengers, and whenever they were played they echoed in dreams and called to the Ogryn who heard them, stoking up both their desire for vengeance for the Red Crusade and feelings of unity and kinship with others of their kind.\r\n\r\nOne strong Ogryn woman with a rare set of powerful lungs and an instinctive sense of rhythm, named Glogg, was chosen to be the bearer of two of these magical tools, the Summoning Horn and the Great War Drum. While they certainly had a pronounced effect on those neutral Ogryn tribes she visited – leading many to join the Pact – it was not enough to turn the tide of the war. Glogg and her horn and drum survived the Pact’s defeat, with the instruments becoming treasured family heirlooms, but almost all such artefacts were destroyed either by the victorious Telerian forces, or the ruthless march of time.\r\n\r\nAs the latest descendant of Glogg, Uugo jealously safeguards both the Summoning Horn and the Great War Drum, and plays them with practiced skill and vigor. She is fiercely proud of the instruments that, though centuries old, remain stout – the drum’s old hide as taut as ever while the horn is crisp and clear. And while there is no longer a true Gaellen Pact for Ogryn to rally to, whenever Uugo plays her instruments those Ogryn around her experience a sense of warlike unity beyond anything they have ever felt or known before. In doing this, Uugo hopes to make Glogg, and all who have played the instruments since, proud.\r\n\r\nUugo sees herself as a keeper of Ogryn tradition, and is therefore a common sight at tribal gatherings, summoning Ogryn from miles around, or indicating the beginning and end of feasts, councils, or competitive games. She hopes to use her instruments to remind her people of their proud heritage, and to bring unity to tribes that are too often split and divided. This has made her a target in the past – she has been hunted by an Aravian noble determined to claim the instruments to study their magical properties, and by agents of the Sacred Order who hope to destroy them and thus help break any sense of kinship among the Ogryn. Despite this, she has met and defeated every challenger, her ongoing efforts to bring together her people backed up by her size, strength, and the damage she can wreak in combat when the Great War Drum is slung on her back and she uses her heavy beating sticks as maces.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5650#static": "Anax’s old existence ended, and his new one began, with the Circlet of Kalreth. An arcane artifact created by the desert sorcerers of a long-dead Krokhan civilization to help protect their clan chiefs, it granted strength and protection to the wearer, but was also imbued with far more potent, secret magics.\r\n\r\nThe circlet became the symbol of the highest rank among the Dune Guards, warriors tasked with protecting the king of the mighty Ankha clan, which in ages past dominated a vast swathe of the Krokhan Desert. For many years they fulfilled their duties. No Ankhan ruler was ever slain by the enemies of the clan, until the reign of Sumrek the Conqueror.\r\n\r\nSumrek was powerful and expansionist, and made many enemies. A rival clan made an unholy pact with the Demonspawn assassin Vengarix, and the commander of the Dune Guards, Captain Anax, could not stop him from striking the fatal blow against Sumrek. Horrified at failing not only his ruler but the legacy of all Guard commanders who had gone before, Anax agreed to the ritual proscribed for those found wanting in the line of duty. When Sumrek was interred in his tomb, Anax was walled-up in with him, still alive. Upon his brow the Circlet of Kalreth remained, for the gravity of his failure meant the Dune Guards were disbanded, and it would never be passed on to another commander.\r\n\r\nAnax’s fate was terrible enough, but the Circlet made it worse. Unbeknownst to any in the clan, the advantages that came to its wearer had a price. If the warrior who wore it failed in his duties to protect the king, it would maintain his life until he was able to extract vengeance upon the one who had struck the killing blow, if they themselves yet lived. The fact that Sumrek’s killer was an immortal Demonspawn ensured that Anax awoke to his Undead existence after dying of thirst still entombed with the corpse of his king.\r\n\r\nHow long Anax’s mind remained whole after that is impossible to say. All that is certain is that it was over six centuries before thieves disturbed Sumrek’s tomb, and when they did they found the former Captain of the Guard now a dusty, walking corpse, the Circlet of Kalreth still gleaming on his skeletal brow. He was, by this point, completely insane, having spent centuries trying and failing to escape.\r\n\r\nAnax slaughtered the unfortunate thieves who had unwittingly freed him, their blood awakening the long-dormant poisons of his enchanted shotel blades. He then stumbled from the accursed tomb and staggered off into the desert, and the night.\r\n\r\nIt took centuries more for Anax to recover even a fragment of his own mind, only the arcane pull of his crown giving him the merest degree of focus. He latched on to the belief that he had to track down Vengarix, for while a Demonspawn could not be truly killed, he hoped that slaying Vengarix’s physical body would be enough to grant himself a reprieve, and the end to his maddened existence he craved. While that may be the case, finding Vengarix has proven to be a challenge, for the Demonspawn assassin is a shadow that seems to live more in legend than in Teleria’s reality. Anax’s deathless quest continues, and stories of the wandering, raving Undead ‘king’ abound, the tellers not knowing that the crown he wears upon his ancient skull is not actually a sign of kingship and authority, but a terrible curse.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5660#static": "Fahrakin the Fat is a name well-known to the gamblers and guild-bosses of Velyzar. Once, he was just another nameless fighter, destined to die in an arena and be forgotten. Now, he is one of the most powerful chieftains of the Krokhan Desert. \r\n\r\nFahrakin was but a boy when his father, an animal handler for the Caravan Guild, sold him to the Gladiator Guild in return for his debts being forgiven. The youth had strength and stamina, but no real skill. He underwent a brutal training regimen that was nearly the death of him more than once, but he persevered and took his place in an arena. At first, he was intended to be fodder and nothing more; a minor challenge for a more popular fighter, or something to whet the appetite of one of the monsters employed in the pits.\r\n\r\nBut during his first bout, matched against one of the large sand-scaled lizard-beasts of the Krokhan, the crowd watched in stupefaction as the young gladiator distracted the beast with the polished surface of his shield, and then deftly sliced through the tendons in three of its six legs. He clearly knew its weaknesses. With the monster incapitated, Fahrakin allowed himself a moment of triumph. It was almost his undoing. The lizard-beast spat venom at him, momentarily blinding him and burning his flesh. Fahrakin collapsed in agony. \r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, Fahrakin found himself confronted by the wizened, grinning face of one of the arena beastmasters, Ouse. Ouse was not a man of Velyzar, but rather the chieftain of a Nomad clan contracted as beast-hunters by the Arena Guild. Ouse questioned Fahrakin and found that the young man’s father had taught him how to observe an animal and render it harmless. Intrigued, Ouse asked Fahrakin if he would be interested in joining his clan. Fahrakin readily agreed, preferring the much less dangerous life of a Nomad to that of a gladiator. \r\n\r\nIn the months that followed, Ouse taught young Fahrakin more about hunting. The desert was inhospitable and full of unnatural creatures. Great cats with armored hides prowled the crags and pebble-scaled serpents large enough to swallow a horse lay in wait beneath the sands. The Arena Guild desired such monsters to act as star attractions between more traditional bouts. But Ouse was old, and he hoped that the excelling Fahrakin would take his place as beastmaster. But first, there was one final test to pass. \r\n\r\nFahrakin was sent into the desert to capture a lizard-beast to replace the one he’d injured in his debut. After several days he found one’s trail and located its lair. He remembered the venom, this time blocking it with the same polished shield he distracted the creature with. He returned to the clan dragging the bound and disabled reptilian, and Ouse welcomed him as a full member of his clan. Fahrakin went on to capture many beasts for the arenas, and brought much wealth to his new people. And in time, he replaced his mentor not just as beastmaster, but as chieftain. \r\n\r\nThese days, Fahrakin rarely conducts monster hunts himself, having grown sedentary in his age, behavior that has earned him his derogatory moniker. Instead, he has trained his people to find and capture the monsters the arenas hunger for. But no one but himself is allowed to handle the great branding iron gifted to him by his mentor. With it, Fahrakin marks the captive creature as the property of his clan, so that all who see it in the arenas will know who captured it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5670#static": "Many Orcs enjoy the thrill of combat, and spend their entire lives seeking the rush that comes in the white heat of battle. The heightened senses, the surge of power, and the delicate dance between life and death all make for an intoxicating experience that nothing else comes close to. For a small minority of Orcs, the need for this feeling is so overwhelming that they end up in an early grave, after launching themselves into fights they could never hope to win. These ‘Battlelusters’ are few and far between, and often forgotten, for their lives tend to end early. There is one Orc of this ilk however whose exploits were legendary: Iron Brago. \r\n\r\nIron Brago was proclaimed leader of his clan before reaching adulthood, such was his immense strength and prowess. Wielding a solid iron mace in each hand, and wearing thick iron armor so heavy it could almost crush most Orcs, Brago’s battle lust propelled him like an internal motor. Even before he was fully grown there were few who came close to matching his strength, and the ease with which he defeated opponents left him unfulfilled. Thus he continually sought new ways to test the limits of his abilities. Though his actions frequently put his clan in danger, whether that be insulting rival clan leaders, or encroaching on enemy territories to provoke a response, no one dared to challenge him. \r\n\r\nFresh from defeating a small Dwarven enclave of the Skyiron Dominion, Brago brought his clan to the edge of the Stormwind Wastes, a desolate place home to monsters of myriad heinous kinds. Despite the protestations of clan members who were fearful of what may lie within this scarred and hellish land, they set up camp, Brago hopeful that perhaps here he would finally find the challenge he had been searching for. That night, he dreamed of fire, desolation, and countless Demonspawn. He dreamed of a place of violence and cruelty, where only the strongest would survive. The picture shifted, coming out of that plane and back into Teleria, where a portal stood open in the depths of a ravine. Slowly the picture drew back even further, tracing a line out of the ravine, through the Stormwind Wastes, and directly to where Brago’s clan was camped. The Orc woke with a start, certain that he had finally found his calling. He would venture into the heart of the Wastes, find this portal, and wage glorious battle in the hellish place of his vision he was certain was behind it.\r\n\r\nBrago did not wait for dawn before waking his clan. He told them of his vision, and that those who wished to leave were free to do so. Some two thirds did. For those who remained, there was trepidation and excitement. Brago spoke with fervor and zeal of the glories that awaited them, and of burying their blades in the bodies of a thousand Demonspawn and more. In a near frenzied state, they crossed into the Wastes. Their journey was long, and bloody. Their numbers were depleted by half, then half again, as Demonspawn, Undead creatures, and nightmarish beasts attacked them. Not a day passed without violence, each Orc exhausting themselves to keep pace with the tireless Brago, whose energy seemed to only grow with each passing battle. Forever onward they plowed in a relentless onslaught into the depths of the Wastes, bodies piling high as they carved a path to their destination.\r\n\r\nAfter seven straight days of marching with little food or rest, it became clear to Brago they were finally nearing the portal. The air thickened and closed around them, and an oppressive heat threatened to singe their flesh. The Orc and his few remaining warriors descended deeper into the ravine with renewed enthusiasm, the assault of Demonspawn, monsters, and Undead coming thicker than ever. Though they continued to push forward through the caves and tunnels, one by one Brago’s warriors fell, until only Brago remained. Unmoved by the losses, and not giving an inch to his enemies, he continued to smash his maces into the skulls of his enemies, laughing as he did so and insulting their courage, skill, and strength. While the fate of Iron Brago is lost to time, it is certain that in the crescendo of this battle he finally found the exhilaration and meaning he had been searching for.",

He embraced warlike ways, but failed to heed his father’s lessons in the importance of cunning and foresight. He assumed all would submit to him when his time to rule came, confident none could best him in combat.\r\n\r\nWhen Skargar passed away, enemies that had been spreading their influence within the Thunder Bringers struck. Dhukk’s uncle, Grimgar, coveted the position of chieftain. After the great feast held to mark Dhukk’s accession, while much of the clan lay in a drunken stupor, Grimgar made his play. He set fire to the clan’s hall, then sounded the alarm. During the chaos, his followers dragged the inebriated Dhukk into the surrounding Durham Forest. They would have killed him, but even in his drunken state Dhukk was a ferocious warrior. He slew two of his captors and extracted the truth about the betrayal from the last before killing him, too. He tried to return to the clan, but passed out in the forest’s darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen Dhukk awoke, he found himself bound atop the back of a wagon. An Ogryn approached and introduced herself as Bozz, a name Dhukk recognized – she was an infamous slaver. She told Dhukk in no uncertain terms that he was now her property.\r\n\r\nDhukk fought his bonds and demanded that Bozz free him – he was a chieftain, and would wreak terrible vengeance if she did not obey. Bozz paid no heed. In the months that followed Dhukk was pitched against other slaves in a spate of gladiatorial bouts. He killed without hesitation, driven into terrible rages by the knowledge of Grimgar’s treachery. The brutal Orc was soon top billing among the gladiatorial duels.\r\n\r\nDhukk’s attempted escape again and again. He killed numerous guards, yet failed every time. Bozz seemed to enjoy the trouble Dhukk caused. After each escape attempt, she had a scrap of iron driven into his torso, leaving him pierced with wicked metal shards that also served as crude armor. Bozz ruthlessly mocked Dhukk, saying the protection would be necessary, as his continued failure to escape ensured he would see more action in the pits. The pain of his piercings, combined with his anger and frustration, slowly eroded the former chief’s sanity.\r\n\r\nDhukk lost himself in the thing he had always loved most – fighting. The Orc’s mental state steadily broke. He shouted at imaginary figures and randomly burst into abrupt, harsh laughter. He attacked other slaves, and had to be isolated in a spiked cage between bouts, all the while viciously taunting anyone nearby – real or imagined – and demanding they face him in combat. His fighting style degenerated too, reduced to wild frenzies.\r\n\r\nTo further amuse herself and test the depths of Dhukk’s insanity, Bozz claimed that one Human prisoner she held was in fact Grimgar and threw him into the ring with the Orc. Dhukk flew into a frenzy and hacked the man to pieces, claiming afterwards that he had finally earned his revenge and was once more master of his clan. Bozz, as part of the ongoing jest, had the Human’s remains mounted on Dhukk’s crude shield. Dhukk now seemed like nothing more than a living weapon, cold steel whittled and honed down, stripped of everything but its cruel edge. That may have been merely what Dhukk wished Bozz to believe. Perhaps, behind his insane grin, lurked the cunning he neglected to acquire before his enslavement, carefully concealed, until the time was right.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5760#static": "All beings in Teleria are the result of Lumaya and Siroth’s Dances of Creation, and so have within them both light and darkness. For the immortal Lightbringers and Demons – the Firstborn – this is no longer so. To have the darkness torn from one is a pain of such exquisite intensity that few Lightbringers allow themselves to recall it. Better, instead, to look to the light and forget that the darkness ever existed within them at all. But some cannot – will not – forget so easily. To forget the darkness is to lose oneself entirely in the light, to become as a statue; unchanging for the eternities to come. \r\n\r\nOr so the Lightbringer known as Cardiel believes.\r\n\r\nFor him, the memory of the time before the Dance of Uncreation that banished the Lightbringers to the Halls of Eternity and ripped their darkness from them is akin to a wound that will not heal. Where other Lightbringers are content with the serenity of perfection, to be unchanging and fixed in both thought and appearance, Cardiel holds fast to himself – to the warrior he was, in the dim days of the Primordial Age. In the time before the schism that set the Firstborn at each other’s throats.\r\n\r\nIn those days, he had been a wanderer; an adventurous soul whose pleasure was in exploration of the world. During this time, he watched the mortal races spread across Teleria, taking what they had been given and changing it to suit their needs. Intrigued, he studied them, learning all he could. Nor was Cardiel the only one to become interested in the doings of the mortals. He soon found a companion in his studies, a fellow Firstborn named Sicia.\r\n\r\nThe two immortals wandered Teleria together, and as the days turned into months and years, their friendship blossomed into something more – something that neither Cardiel nor Sicia truly understood. Cardiel found that she made him feel whole; as if she were a part of him that he had all but forgotten until the moment of their meeting. Her sadness made him ache, and her smile made his heart sing. \r\n\r\nAt first, he was too bewildered to ask if she felt the same. When he finally mustered the courage, he was overjoyed to find that she too felt this strange connection. But before they could explore these new feelings, Siroth betrayed Lumaya.\r\n\r\nHorrified by Siroth’s actions, Cardiel swore himself to Lumaya’s service, but Sicia disagreed, believing that Siroth was right and that Lumaya was simply too stubborn to see it. They argued bitterly in the days that followed, each trying to convince the other that they had chosen the wrong path. Neither would be budged. Soon, unable to stay together, they went their separate ways. \r\n\r\nDespite this, they could not deny their bond. They avoided each other where they could, and when forced by circumstance to take to the same field of battle, they refused to fight against each other – a fact which often aroused the ire of their allies. But they remained true to one another and the affections that had blossomed between them.\r\n\r\nFor Cardiel, Sicia’s absence only made his feelings for her grow stronger. He began to seek her out, hoping to convince her of the rightness of Lumaya’s cause. Though these conversations grew heated, their love never dimmed. Neither would so much as raise a blade against the other, and soon their peers knew better than to expect it. \r\n\r\nEven the Dance of Uncreation and the banishment of the Firstborn from Teleria could not entirely sever this bond. Despite being purged of his own inner darkness, and transformed into something glittering and graceful, Cardiel still ached for Sicia. He resigned himself to an eternity of stoic isolation in the Halls of Eternity, his only consolation the knowledge that his beloved Sicia was safely doing the same in shadowy Anathraad. Siroth’s followers had been banished there, their light ripped from them. They became Demons.\r\n\r\nThen came the Age of Hellfire, and Siroth’s assault on Teleria. Cardiel and other Lightbringers were roused to war by the Arbiter, given means to enter the world both dark and desperate. When the time came to take the battle to Siroth’s forces, he stood at the forefront, unfazed by the sacrifice of so many mortals to bring him and his kind to the war. \r\n\r\nIt was during one such battle that he took note of one Demonspawn – something about it seemed unsettlingly familiar. He fought his way towards the creature, compelled to confront it by some unidentifiable instinct. He roared out a challenge. The Demonspawn turned. Their eyes locked across the battlefield.\r\n\r\nAnd he knew. \r\n\r\nAs did she. \r\n\r\nBanished, changed, they yet knew one another, and their souls called out even as the clarion to war sounded once more…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5770#static": "All beings in Teleria are the result of the Dances of Creation performed by Siroth and Lumaya, and so have within them both Light and Darkness. For those known as the Firstborn, the immortal Lightbringers and Demons, however, this is no longer so. But with smoke must come fire, and with shadow, light. One cannot exist without the other. Or so Sicia Flametongue believes in her heart of hearts. Though she is corrupted by Darkness like all Demonspawn, there is nonetheless something of the person that she once was that yet flickers within her. \r\n\r\nBefore the Great Divorce between Siroth and Lumaya, Sicia was simply another Firstborn. Clever and adventurous, she explored the world and sought to learn all that she could about those peoples who had been created after hers. She found them fascinating, not just because they were so different from herself, but because they had so much to teach her. Nor was she alone in her fascination. She soon found another Firstborn, Cardiel, who shared her delight in the doings of the mortal races.\r\n\r\nThey roamed Teleria together for years, but Sicia became tired of the antics of those she had once found fascinating. Yet as her boredom grew, so too did her feelings for her companion. It was a sensation she had never felt before and, at first, she was too confused to ask if he felt the same. He confessed his love for her however and she was overjoyed to find that he too felt the connection. But before they could explore these new feelings, conflict arose between Lumaya and Siroth, pitching the Firstborn into a war that threatened to consume them all. The central issue of the clash was Lumaya’s refusal to conclude the Seventh Dance of Creation – the Dance of Darkness.  \r\n\r\nSicia could not believe Lumaya’s apparent inability to see the sense in Siroth’s desire to add new and interesting things to a world that she felt was becoming dull. She tried to convince Cardiel that Lumaya’s way would condemn the world to stagnation, but he disagreed. Instead, he abandoned Sicia and pledged his loyalty to Lumaya.\r\n\r\nAngered by what she saw as Cardiel’s betrayal, Sicia joined Siroth and quickly rose in his esteem as one of his most trusted lieutenants. She became infamous for her ability to convince Lumaya’s followers to switch sides – all save one, however. Cardiel resisted her efforts time and again, and more than once while speaking to him, she felt her own loyalties waver.\r\n\r\nDespite their disagreement, Sicia knew that her bond with Cardiel was just as strong as it had been before the Great Divorce. She wished she could make him see sense before it was too late. Then came Lumaya’s banishment spell, and Sicia was dragged to Anathraad, along with the other Firstborn who had served Siroth. There, all the Light was purged from her, and her form became twisted and nightmarish. Great horns sprouted from her skull, and wings of infernal flame rose from her back. Her transformation into a Demon was painful – but even more so was her surety that she would never see her beloved again.\r\n\r\nThis proved not to be the end, however. In the age that followed, Siroth found a means to invade Teleria, and Sicia was at the forefront. It was not simply her loyalty to Siroth that drove her, but also a burning desire to see the world she had once explored with Cardiel. It had changed much in the intervening years, and she was determined to explore it as she had before the Great Divorce. But Siroth’s forces, including Sicia, were ultimately defeated and cast back to Anathraad. \r\n\r\nThen came the Age of Hellfire. Siroth invaded the world once more, and once more Sicia was at the forefront of his armies. But something had changed. The Arbiter had found a way for Lumaya’s Firstborn followers – the Lightbringers – to re-enter Teleria after they had been cast into the Halls of Eternity by the banishment spell, much like Siroth's own Demonspawn. The Lightbringers descended from on high to battle Siroth’s forces. Demonspawn and Lightbringer clashed again and again. \r\n\r\nIt was during one such confrontation that Sicia found her attention drawn to one Lightbringer in particular, who was somehow familiar to her. As the shimmering being roared out a challenge, something about his face snapped into focus. With a start, she realized who it was that hurtled across the battlefield towards her. \r\n\r\nCardiel. \r\n\r\nAnd when their eyes met, she saw that he recognized her as well…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5780#static": "When the Second Great War between the forces of the Arbiter and Siroth raged through Teleria, it steadily became apparent that while the Lightbringers were warriors almost without equal, they rarely made for great strategists. An inability to properly appreciate the vulnerabilities of the mortal warriors under their command, coupled with a certain lack of imagination, ensured that a number of the campaigns waged by Lightbringer-led forces became mired in setbacks.\r\n\r\nAstralon was believed by some to be the answer to this problem. The being who became known as the Crimson Angel elected, by his own volition, not to serve in a senior position, but as a humble soldier in the armies of Teleria. In doing so, he experienced the wars between the forces of Light and Shadow first-hand, down amid the dirt, fighting in the heart of the melee, and seeing the hardship and privation of each campaign play out, from low supplies or inclement weather to the sufferings of the wounded after battle. In this way, Astralon built an empathy with the regular soldiers around him that he would not forget when he finally accepted command of a host of his own. \r\n\r\nAppreciating the importance of supplies, aid for the wounded, and the morale of the lower troops, he built the host he was given command of and honed it into an efficient fighting force before leading it to a string of victories, in which he all-but secured eastern Anhelt against Siroth’s ravaging hordes. It seemed as though the armies of Teleria had found their general, and the Crimson Angel soon became wildly popular among the rank-and-file he had once served alongside.\r\n\r\nAstralon may indeed have won the war for the Arbiter by himself, had he not so swiftly met his match on the battlefield. It was at the Battle of the Seven Passes where he first encountered the Demonspawn known as Countess Lix, mistress of plagues and a wickedly effective commander in her own right. A spree of brutal battles between them followed – Holdmire; Red Mount; Iqane. At Melchien Fields, Astralon permitted his center to cave before the Demonspawn assault, allowing his wings to outflank the enemy and almost envelop Lix’s forces, but the countess escaped. His victory was undone at Castle Strevax, where his Sacred Order forces, coming to drive away Lix’s host besieging the castle's garrison were unable to break through the layered Demonspawn defense in time to save the castle's defenders, despite Astralon leading from the front.\r\n\r\nOn and on the pair fought, the advantage swinging one way and then the other, neither able to strike a killing blow. It could not continue forever. Finally, the decisive clash both had sought played out, between two great rocks known as the Twin Spires, on the southern edges of Durham Forest.\r\n\r\nHoping that this would be the final confrontation, both Astralon and Lix threw themselves into combat. They met in a titanic clash of blades, claws, and energies so potent it cast the surrounding combatants into the dirt. After what felt like an age, Lix fled, beating her tainted, metallic pinions and leaping skyward. Quick as a flash of crimson lightning, Astralon pursued, refusing to let his nemesis escape.\r\n\r\nThe battle between the two Firstborn played out in the sky, actinic ruby and emerald lightning ripping apart the skies and cowing even the fury of the combatants below. For a day and a night the two leaders were absent from the field. Finally, Astralon returned to the bloodied survivors of his host. He would not speak of his duel, nor who had won, saying only that Lix, too, had survived.\r\n\r\nThere was consternation among the forces of the Order as it seemed Astralon had truly met his match. Certainly, he never seemed to command the armies of Light with quite as much surety as before, his decisiveness lacking the edge it once had. It was as though he had left a vital part of himself up there in the skies, or perhaps with the now-departed, dreaded countess. Some even claimed that Lix had ensnared Astralon with a curse.\r\n\r\nEventually, and to the shock of many, Astralon relinquished his command. He declared himself unfit to oversee them, and swore to the Arbiter that he would engage upon a personal quest to find Countess Lix. He did not specify quite what he would do if he found her, though many naturally assumed he intended to destroy his arch-rival once and for all. Those with a more subtle disposition suspected something else, sensing how the final clash with his former enemy had changed him.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5790#static": "The title of Godseeker is only conferred by the Sacred Order upon those who have achieved great victories against existential threats far from its core territories. Captain Aniri won this title after she and her forces were sent to a small Elven colony in the Dusk Hills, one of few firm footholds the Order had in all Peltas. Her mission was to investigate a sighting of outriders from the cursed mage-city of Ireth. Not three days away from the colony, Aniri identified her quarry.\r\n\r\nCaptain Aniri tracked the riders to their camp, but arrived just in time to witness others doing her work for her: a Gaellen patrol was butchering the last of the Irethi riders. Aniri did not hesitate – she ordered an immediate attack on the Gaellens, catching them off-guard. The Orc and Lizardmen fighters surrendered quickly, and Aniri’s men begged to slaughter the monsters. But Aniri had never spoken with a Gaellen, and opted to interrogate the commander – an Orc, named Tuhak the Wanderer – first.\r\n\r\nShe found it good that she did. Tuhak warned of a larger force of Irethi raiders on the way to the Elven colony. The Gaellens had planned to let the raiders weaken themselves on the Elves before attacking, but Aniri could not allow it. It would be too easy for the raiders to attack the colony's civilians. If Aniri’s forces fought in the hills instead, they could catch the enemy in an ambush and nullify their greater numbers. Tuhak agreed, and to Aniri’s surprise, suggested an alliance. Better to fight together, he argued, then let the enemy win – otherwise, Ireth might return, and it would only be a matter of time before they came for Gaellens instead of Elves. Wary of betrayal, but even more afraid of defeat, Captain Aniri agreed.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Gaellens and the Sacred Order marched to their ambush position and waited for the enemy. They did not wait long. Soon enough, the Irethi raiders were in place, and Aniri signaled the attack. The allied forces struck with the force of a hammer upon an anvil, but they swiftly lost momentum. Knowing they could not win a drawn-out fight, Aniri sought out the Irethi commander – a massive man-beast clad in black armor – in an attempt to break the foe’s morale. The fight was hard, as the beast’s skin radiated a terrible magical heat – even being close to him caused Aniri pain. Her faith and endurance proved inadequate – the monster finally grabbed her face in his searing hand and smashed her head into the ground. She screamed in agony as he tried to crush her, but in her final moments of consciousness, she saw Tuhak’s blade part the monster’s head from its shoulders. Then, all went black.\r\n\r\nWhen Aniri woke, the Gaellens were gone. Her sergeant told her that the Gaellens had run when the fighting was nearly over. They had even looted the Sacred Order’s camp on the way out. He spat at their name, and called them cowards. Aniri wasn’t so sure, but she kept that to herself.\r\n\r\nUpon her victorious return to Anhelt, Aniri was made Godseeker and was offered the opportunity to return to Peltas, to hunt down Tuhak and his fellows. She refused, saying her burns left her with little taste for battle. But the truth was, her faith had been shaken. She took up a post in the Eternal Citadel instead, where she hoped being in the Sacred Order’s cathedral-capital would quiet her mind. \r\n\r\nQuiet, however, was not what Godseeker Aniri found.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5800#static": "Even among Demonspawn, there are few denizens of Anathraad that mortals hold in as much fear as Countess Lix, for the matters which she holds hellish sovereignty over – disease, plague, and infection – are ever-present curses upon the living. Whenever a pandemic sweeps through Teleria, wherever crops wither with blight, when water stagnates and boils fester, there the dreaded countess draws her strength. Her particular affinity for disease is a fortunate trait for a being of evil to possess, for Teleria is always experiencing an outbreak of some form of plague or another, and these are a source of strength to Lix. She does not merely act as a harbinger of infection, however. As far as her fellow Demonspawn are concerned, Countess Lix is a figure of tragedy and a cautionary tale for those who find their thoughts lingering on anything that is not service toward Siroth, or devastation wreaked upon Teleria.\r\n\r\nIn the great wars that raged as Siroth sought to exert control over Teleria, she showed herself a deadly fighter and, above all, a wickedly sharp strategist and general. Great were her victories, and great were the rewards Siroth bestowed for them. Most notably, she was raised up within the blasphemous nobility of Anathraad, granted the title of countess and corresponding fiefdoms in that terrible dimension. It seemed as though Lix would carry on and secure a place as first among the Demonspawn, Siroth’s favored general and dealer of death.\r\n\r\nBut Siroth could not have anticipated the fate that eventually befell the cursed countess. Lumaya fought back against Siroth’s depredations, her own heroes, warriors of Light, taking the battle to the legions of darkness. Lightbringers, those who had sided with Lumaya during the Great Divorce, soon led the resistance against the Demonspawn in Teleria, and none were more potent when it came to matters of tactics or strategy than Astralon, the Crimson Angel.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the armies of Countess Lix and Astralon clashed, first at the Battle of the Seven Passes, then again, indecisively, at Mordrun. Yet more engagements followed, at Silver Ford, Melchien Fields, at Morrowburn, Castle Strevax, and Holdmire. At Red Mount the countess seemed to have the advantage, only for her forces to fall into a deadly trap laid by Astralon. At Iqane, this happened in reverse, as a wide outflanking movement by Astralon’s cavalry was preempted and cut-off by Lix’s reserves. Again and again, the armies of the two great generals clashed, and again and again the battles ended in stalemate, or a pyrrhic victory for one or the other.\r\n\r\nIt could not continue forever. Finally, at the Battle of the Twin Spires, Lix and Astralon met in personal combat. Their clash was so furious, so potent, that those nearby were cast aside by the outpouring of power. Back and forth the pair strove, until Lix took flight, seeking advantage in the air. Astralon pursued, the pair hurtling into the heavens before he was able to catch her. The skies were filled with thunder, and viridian and crimson energies lit the clouds as the remnants of both armies broke off, looking upwards in a vain attempt to follow the titanic duel. For a night and a day the duo fought, uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nCountess Lix eventually returned to her followers. She said nothing of what happened, nor even if she had been triumphant. It appeared that her mind was occupied by other matters. Her campaigns petered out, and even the plagues that followed her lost their potency.\r\n\r\nThen news arrived that Astralon’s army was on the march once more. A terrible determination entered the countess. Fate, however, would keep her from meeting Astralon on the battlefield again. The war for Teleria was going poorly, and Siroth had need of Lix’s Demonspawn elsewhere. And so, with a heavy heart, she marched away, swearing as she did that she would one day see Astralon again.\r\n\r\nMost fellow Demonspawn assume Countess Lix seeks the destruction of her Lightbringer nemesis, but there are some scurrilous rumors that there is something more to their rivalry, a particular bond born out of their mutual enmity. If that is the case, it would bring Siroth’s terrible wrath upon Lix, yet it seems the countess is willing to run that risk for her opposite number. For to this day, she strives to encounter the Crimson Angel once again, and will not rest until they are reunited.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5810#static": "Genzin grew up in both awe and fear of the Mistwood. While the stories of the Sylvan Elves who resided there were fascinating to him, tales that emphasized their wisdom and nobility, it was the other denizens of the Mistwood that he found particularly alluring. The Fae, creatures of spirit and otherworldly substance that took on the most peculiar of visages, seemed to forever be at the edges of Genzin’s mind. Growing up in the shadow of the Mistwood just a few miles north of its border, he often found himself staring at the forest, as if beckoned by some spectral whisper. Though he always resisted the temptation to venture inside, knowing full well what often happened to those who entered into the Mistwood uninvited, the feeling persisted that something, or someone, was waiting for him, there in the unknowable depths of the trees. He was taken away from his home for many years after being conscripted into the military of the Mikage Autocracy. He served aboard the great warship, the Atatsu, named for a legendary fire-breathing snake-spirit of the sea. For years he raided distant lands, later becoming a captain of marines, earning the monikers 'the Steel Flow' and the 'Deathflame' for his brutally effective tactics, use of the terror-weapon known as 'unquenchable fire', and incredible bladesmanship. After his time of service was complete, he returned to his home, having always felt a deep yearning to return the great wood.\r\n\r\nOne late summer evening, while the sun was still high, Genzin found himself at the very foot of the forest. He did not know how he arrived there, for he certainly did not set out for this place, but as he stood and stared into the darkness of the wood he was certain he could hear his name being called in the whistle of the wind in the trees. Drawing up all the courage he could muster, he crossed into the lush expanse, where he was struck by an immediate sense of direction and purpose. Striding forward with inexplicable knowledge of where he was going, but not what his destination was, Genzin drove further and further into the forest’s depths. He kept on at a rapid pace, unable to slow himself even if he wanted to, until he came to a halt in a clearing. Flowers of dazzling colors painted the floor, shimmering mists lingered in the air, and the light that pierced the canopy bathed the scene in a golden glow. At the center of it all was a small waterfall, delicately cascading into a mirror-like pool.\r\n\r\nA hush then descended on this magical place, even the sound of the steady trickle of water ceasing, when a figure emerged from the basin of the waterfall. It was almost Human in appearance, with a face bearing an expression of serene grace. The creature’s skin seemed to flow like water over its body, and glistened in the warm light. It was a Fae. She revealed herself to Genzin as the Duchess of Rushing Water, one who had dominion over streams, rivers, glaciers, brooks – all that flows. A silver, glittering tiara with gemstones of crystalline dewdrops seemed to prove her status. The duchess then invited the Shadowkin to speak. Genzin fell to his knees in reverence, and spoke eagerly about the connection he had always felt with the Mistwood, and the deep curiosity he always had for the Fae. The duchess gave a wide, enchanting smile, and revealed that it was she who had called him to the Mistwood. She had foreseen that the forest would need a protector, one unattuned to the Rhythm yet who cared deeply about this place. Genzin offered himself without hesitation, declaring he would gladly give his life to serve a being as wondrous as her. With the vow made, the duchess sent Genzin from her clearing, and told him to return when he felt her summons once again.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed as Genzin waited to be called back to the duchess. Those weeks soon turned to months, which turned to years. As time went by, Genzin grew more and more concerned that something was wrong, that perhaps he had missed some sign, signal, or summons. Five years passed, and as day broke on the anniversary of his first encounter with the duchess, he suddenly felt an anguished voice calling out to him from the heart of the Mistwood. Dashing straight to the clearing with the waterfall, he arrived too late, finding the place scorched and desolate. Instead of the duchess, all he found was a pair of skittering Demonspawn, toying with the broken pieces of her tiara, which still glistened, even more radiant when set against the now hideously scarred landscape. Enraged, he charged the two unsuspecting creatures and beheaded both. As his battle-fury subsided, he picked up the pieces of the tiara. Then he fell to his knees, overwhelmed with grief. He made a new vow – avenge the apparent death of the duchess, and kill all the Demonspawn he could find.",

He hated taking orders, resented those who considered themselves his superior, flouted rules on discipline and orderly conduct, and missed every reveille due to a hangover.

And most importantly, he was a true believer in the cause of the rebellion, and hated the cruel Mikage Demonspawn with a fierce passion.\r\n\r\nHe survived campaign after brutal campaign, until after years of civil war, the Mikage were dethroned and the Shadowkin liberated from their dark masters. Yoshi’s celebration with the victorious troops was so legendarily debauched that, with victory achieved, he was cut loose. This dismissal troubled him little, for he was more than ready to leave his nagging commanders behind and wander the newly-freed realm, feasting and brawling as he went. Eventually he spent all the spoils of his soldiering career, and blearily realized he’d need a new livelihood. Hungry and tired, he wandered into a monastery just as the monks were performing their morning ablutions, meditating, and praying in the early light. Yoshi loudly demanded hospitality, but the monks were in no mood to oblige the rude drunkard’s demands. When he refused to leave they threatened violence, and Yoshi took up the challenge gleefully. \r\n\r\nYoshi badly underestimated what he took to be a pack of scrawny mystics. Their martial arts were unlike anything he’d ever experienced, their motions incredibly precise and controlled compared to his huge swipes and stomps. His opponents wasted not a single bit of movement or energy, and let Yoshi tire himself out with clumsy and easily-thwarted attacks. When the monks were satisfied that Yoshi had been thoroughly made a fool of, they struck clusters of nerves in his neck and chest, numbing his limbs and dealing him crippling pain. Suddenly sobered up and forced to admit defeat, Yoshi begged forgiveness and asked to learn more of the monks’ techniques.\r\n\r\nThe monks were in turn quietly impressed by Yoshi’s brute strength and were intrigued by his unique fighting style, which they compared to that of an intoxicated bear. With effort and patience there was much they could learn from each other, and so Yoshi was inducted as a pupil. It was no easy transition for the boisterous tippler, for life in the monastery was much more severe than that of a soldier. But he found himself centered, grounded, in tune with his inner thoughts and his hulking body. He’d never before experienced such calmness and purpose, and in knowing himself his fighting skill improved quickly as well. In exchange, he demonstrated how his weaving, staggering, unpredictable movements in battle were not always the besotted mistakes they might appear to be, but a calculated means of disrupting an opponent’s timing and spacing. Thanks to his surprisingly limber physique he was capable of making fast twists and turns his opponents could never expect, meaning he could strike time and again with little forewarning of where or how. Spitting a mouthful of high-proof rice wine into the enemy’s eyes, after swallowing a bit for himself, was always an option.\r\n\r\nYoshi was happy, but his wanderlust built up unsated, and so after several years of soul-searching and refinement, he bid farewell to the monastery and left to see the world and sample its pleasures. The Shadowkin monks could hardly approve of such a course, but they knew better than to argue with their bull-headed disciple when it came to his heart’s desire for endless freedom. Having already wandered much of Yakai, Yoshi longed to see the wider world. First he voyaged through the tunneled thoroughfares of the Skyiron Dominion. He sampled the finest Dwarven brews, entertained vagabonds and wenches with bawdy stories, and emerged on the other side facing the forbidding Stormwind Wastes and beyond that the harsh Krokhan Desert. Laden with as many kegs as he could carry, Yoshi plunged in, undaunted. \r\n\r\nAs Yoshi traveled west, tales of a massive, alcohol-soaked vagrant preceded him. He took on mercenary contracts, was bodyguard to a princess, pummeled deadly monsters into submission, and celebrated every adventure with a round of drinks for everyone in the nearest tavern he could locate. Even the High Elves of Aravia took note of this mysterious adventurer from the east. Yoshi the Drunkard was last seen crossing the Valdemar Strait in search of new lands, new challenges, and new forms of fermented beverage to guzzle.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5830#static": "While the Darkness of Siroth roots in the soul of every Demonspawn, not all surrender themselves to it. One such Demonspawn is Jintoro. His father, Hintoro, was a mortal commander in the Mikage Autocracy armies, until the day he accepted Siroth as his lord and master and was elevated to Demonhood. Later he sired Jintoro, who grew up learning the way of the blade by his father’s side.\r\n\r\nCompared to many Demonspawn Mikage leaders, Hintoro was restrained, but suppressing the rebellion sweeping Yakai still required brutal measures. Jintoro witnessed massed executions and torture, and while his father claimed that the rebels behaved no differently, and that allowing them to win would herald in chaos in Yakai, Jintoro could not throw off doubts in the Mikage regime which grew as he became older.\r\n\r\nJintoro later joined the Mikage armies, serving in his father’s retinue and witnessing more brutalities. As they inflicted ever-greater atrocities, Hintoro privately expressed the beginnings of regret to Jintoro. His uncertainties continued to grow, until the Battle of the Western Track, a clash that changed the wavering course of both men. As Hintoro’s column advanced along the borders of the Mistwood, a Sylvan force ambushed them. Jintoro fought hard alongside his father, but could not save him from the flurry of Sylvan arrows that struck his body. With his dying breath, Hintoro implored his son not to waste his existence as he had done, but put some good back into the world. Initially however, Jintoro only wanted revenge.\r\n\r\nAfter the Sylvan melted back into the trees, the surviving Mikage retreated from the Mistwood’s border as swiftly as possible, but not Jintoro. He advanced deeper into the forest, hunting for those who killed his father. Exactly what transpired beneath the dark canopy is known only to Jintoro and the few Sylvan who escaped his jagged, crystalline blade – a cryomantic sword called Blood Freeze. All that is certain is that unearthly howls were heard echoing from the trees by the withdrawing Autocracy soldiers. Weeks later, long after he had been given up for dead, Jintoro re-emerged carrying the antlers and beast-skulls of the Sylvan he had slain.\r\n\r\nHis rage dissipated, and brooding on his sire’s last words, Jintoro found he had no desire to rejoin the Mikage. He deserted, avoiding both the Autocracy and the rebels. Treated with fear and suspicion by the common folk due to his association with the Mikage and Demonic form, he lived as an outcast, until one day he came across a village being pillaged by Autocracy outriders. On a similar impulse to the one that had sent him into the Mistwood, Jintoro attacked and slew the soldiers, saving the villagers.\r\n\r\nAt first the peasants treated Jintoro fearfully, recognizing that the cyan-fleshed warrior in the Mikage armor was a Demonspawn. He showed he meant no harm by surrendering his sword to them, an unprecedented act. Though he was not fully accepted, the people let him live in a shack on the edge of their village.\r\n\r\nDays later, when another band of Mikage raiders were spotted approaching, Jintoro requested his weapon back. Deciding it was worth the risk, the villagers did so, and he wiped out the attackers in short order. Convinced now of his good intentions, they permitted him to keep the blade.\r\n\r\nSoon, stories of the ‘Demon-Knight’ who fought to protect the common folk spread. Peasants from other hamlets in the war-ravaged area traveled to where he was staying, hoping to find safety from Mikage warbands. Jintoro had not intended to become a savior of the people, but it seemed a fitting way to pay back his family’s legacy of darkness. He formed those who were willing to join him into a band of warriors that fought steadfastly to defend common folk as Yakai descended further into chaos.\r\n\r\nIt was only a matter of time before this unaligned element came to the attention of the rebellion. They sought out Jintoro, wary of his Demonic nature. Some leaders among the uprising recommended he be slain, especially those who noted the trophies taken from their Sylvan allies. Others sought to recruit him, but Jintoro stated bluntly that he would not take sides in the ongoing war, but would fight only to protect commoners. Unable to agree, and unwilling to make an enemy of the villages under Jintoro’s protection, the rebellion’s leadership chose to leave him be.\r\n\r\nAfter the Mikage’s destruction, an uneasy peace settled across Yakai, but for Jintoro it was fleeting. One morning, a number of villagers from the settlements he had sworn to protect were found riddled with Sylvan arrows. Soon, other people went missing. It was clear to Jintoro that the Sylvan had not forgotten the legacy of the Battle of Western Track. Realizing that his presence was making the villagers a target, the Demon-Knight of Yakai took up his sword and set out for the Mistwood, and a final reckoning with his fathers’ killers.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5860#static": "The eastern coast of Yakai is a fractured place, dotted with islands great and small, of inlets, coves and bays. In places the land and the sea merge, their struggles yielding no clear victor, creating expanses of marshland and bog that fester and bubble beneath damp mists. Many of these places have a dark reputation with sailors and landlubbers alike, but none are as feared as the swamp known as Brackish.\r\n\r\nIt is not the marsh itself that is the cause of the area’s grim reputation, though it is true that the cloying mud and sudden, rising tides have been the death of many a soul. There is something more than mere nature at work in this bleak corner of Teleria. That something is a Fae known to mortals as Toragi the Frog.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Toragi has always occupied Brackish. Perhaps he was born there, or perhaps he created it, conjuring it up to reflect the fetid contents of his own soul. His lair lies deep within the most inhospitable part of the marshland, a great tree lying fallen and half-consumed in the mire. Its rotten bark now teems with fungal growths and writhing insect larvae, while its hollowed-out trunk serves as a place for the hulking Fae to repose.  \r\n\r\nThe extent of Toragi’s powers is a point of speculation among those who live near Brackish, or are forced to sail by its blighted shoreline. He is blamed for the storms that grip the area, the cloying mists, and the eerie deadlights that wink amid each settling twilight. He has been to known to lure in the lost or the unwitting to feast on their flesh, or their souls, or both. There is more than a kernel of truth to all of this, though he is not merely a nightmarish creature squatting in the midst of the boglands.\r\n\r\nToragi delights in gifts and tall tales. It is believed that by giving him an impressive gift, or telling him a story he considers worthy of his time, is the only way to avoid being gobbled up. In this way, some have encountered Toragi and lived to recount the experience. They speak of a Fae who alternates between morose and jovial, as unpredictable as the shifting marshes themselves.\r\n\r\nStranger still are those who claim to have enlisted Toragi’s aid. It is said that if a traveler can delight Toragi with a truly wondrous tale, the Fae will not only spare the asker’s life, but offer him a bog-blessing, a promise to help during a time of need. Those worthy enough he grants a handful of Brackish mud to take with them, which can be used to summon him.\r\n\r\nA potent stench herald’s the Fae’s arrival, accompanied by his wet, hacking laughter. If summoned to do battle, the Fae throws himself into the fray enthusiastically, wielding his swamp club to devastating effect against whomever his summoner wills. Even the blood of the great brute is toxic and corrosive. Everything about the Fae is noisome, the stink of him enough to turn stomachs, while his pale, blubbery flesh resists all but the most resolute sword and ax blows.\r\n\r\nYet those who bring Toragi to battle need to be wary, for afterwards he will consider his riddle-debt repaid. At best he may depart, but at worst, he will seek further presents or stories. Any who cannot provide these satisfactorily risk the Fae urn his mighty club turned upon them as swiftly as it fell upon their foes.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5930#static": "As the Dwarven holdouts of Gloomdeep Hold and the Skyiron Dominion recovered following the under-empire's destruction, they began a race to the bottom. Both settlements dug deep into the earth to discover new materials, which they traded. Most prospectors chose to reopen the tunnels that were closed to slow the Demonspawn invasion of their realm many years before, hoping that these ancient passageways contained untapped veins of wealth. In their grand search, they discovered long lost archives of Dwarven lore – grand rune libraries that had been either abandoned or overrun by Siroth's legions.\r\n\r\nWhen word of these discoveries reached the Runekeepers of Gloomdeep Hold, several search parties were dispatched to bring back the troves of ancient knowledge. Few Runekeepers were as wise and revered as Brogni – although his journey to recover the lost artifacts would change him forever.\r\n\r\nIn his expedition, Brogni led a number of Runekeepers carefully through the passages that once swarmed with the life of his ancestors. Eventually, they reached a perfectly preserved archive – one that the Runekeepers of the time had barricaded, to protect it from Siroth’s forces. Brogni left his subordinates to begin the laborious cataloging, while he ventured deeper into the catacomb. As he wandered, he noticed an inviting green light emanating from deeper within, accompanied by a soft and sorrowful trill. Mesmerized, he delved deeper, abandoning his team.\r\n\r\nFinally, Brogni arrived in a primeval cavern, its walls aglow with glittering emerald, a gargantuan crystal at its heart. Its body thrummed with light, and the keening that had ensnared Brogni's mind seemed to originate from this vast mineral. Sitting before this weeping gem and listening to its lament, he stretched out a hand to calm it.\r\n\r\nWhen Brogni withdrew his hand, centuries had passed around him. His skin had turned a pallid gray, while his mind raced with the wailing song of the earth. He witnessed a doom that waited for the Dwarves, should they continue their path. He had to tell his people what he had heard. Taking some fragments of the grand crystal of proof of his quest, Brogni ventured back up to the surface.\r\n\r\nObsessed with what he had learned from the crystal’s song, he would become known as the Underpriest – an ancient cleric who preached of the scourge of the crystals, and Teleria’s lament. While he is bizarre to some Dwarves, many have sought the wisdom of this ancient, sallow-faced man who decries the Dwarves’ renewed expansion – for they would bring upon themselves a greater fall than their collapse at the hands of Siroth’s invasion.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5940#static": "After the fall of the Mikage Autocracy, a new era began for the Shadowkin. Forever tainted by their subjugation by Demonspawn, many of the denizens of Yakai sought to resurrect their lost culture, and begin the process of restoring peace, harmony, and justice to their wayward society. In the establishment of the War Divinity, a new religious order born from the Church of Lumaya and dedicated to the violent resistance of Siroth, there existed a vehicle for the Shadowkin to publicly demonstrate their contrition and penance. After the dismantling of the pirate fleets that the Mikage had unleashed upon Teleria’s seas for years, concerted efforts were made to restore trade with neighbors beyond the Skyiron Dominion. Though it was painful, many of the most violent and unpredictable leaders who had led the rebellion against the Mikage, and helped bring down the terrible regime, were killed or exiled to make it clear that a new era of stability was being ushered in. The cumulative effect of this regeneration is that the Shadowkin began to restore themselves in the eyes of the wider world, and were on the path to redemption. That was not something that all Shadowkin were seeking, however.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of her life, Riho Bonespear was taught how to destroy. Sired by a Mikage Demonspawn general, and thereafter raised in its inner circle, she was one of their most potent tools in the violent oppression of the Yakai people. Bent, beaten, and broken into a creature of pure contempt and malice, her early life was spent being honed into an agent of chaos. Her ferocity and skill with a spear, coupled with her deft powers of manipulation and persuasion, made her an unforgiving adversary. Forever kept in the darkness and shadows, and specializing in destroying communities from within, Riho was tasked with infiltrating the nascent rebellion and ensuring its collapse no matter the cost. She knew the rebels would suspect her, given her Demonic visage, and so when she found a resistance cell to infiltrate, she lied to them, spinning a tale of hate and anguish to convince them she wished the Mikage to fall. This was enough to persuade them not to execute her, and she proved herself to them in numerous raids against the Mikage. Soon, she was accepted into the rebellion's leadership and there set about undermining and eroding the core pillars of their movement. Though she did much to scupper and delay the rebels’ plans, in the end she could not prevent the Mikage’s eventual demise. Knowing that her true identity could be at risk, and knowing what fate awaited her if it was discovered, Riho fled the rebellion, taking only her spear with her, hellbent on forging a path of devastation through Yakai. \r\n\r\nLeft without a purpose, and utterly alone in the world, Riho continues to do what she has always done: destroy. Out in the wilds, she roams from coast to coast, killing as many rebels and Yakai civilians as she can in a bid to punish those who ended the order she had invested her life into. Though that rage is primarily directed toward the rebellion, she shows no mercy to any Demonspawn or Mikage, as in her view it was their weakness that led to their defeat. But as she wanders and continues to kill with abandon, questions about her place in the world have fermented in her imposingly horned head. Why had she supported the Mikage? If their rule was necessary, why had they fallen? Where will she go now, if she has no purpose left in Yakai? As she wrestles with these difficult questions, she cannot shake the feeling that somehow spending all that time within the rebellion has somehow poisoned her mind, that she has let their ideals of ‘freedom’ and ‘liberty’ corrupt what she once knew. Riho hasn’t failed to notice that the more she kills, the more she delivers vengeance to those who wronged her, the louder these questions seem to grow.\r\n\r\nThough she does not know it yet, Riho Bonespear will soon reach a crossroads. The path she is on, one of death and destruction onto which she was placed as a child, is not granting her the satisfaction she seeks. The questions that plague her conscience will not quiet, and the rage that drives her will is starting to wane. Should she have the strength to push beyond what she was told about the order of the world, to see past the ideology of hate, power, and subjugation in which she was raised, she may yet find a purpose far greater than the one she had in the Mikage Autocracy. For the first time in her life, Riho's future is in her own hands.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5980#static": "The black boughs of Durham Forest hide many terrible things from the world. Few are more terrible than that most enigmatic of beings, Ruel the Huntmaster. His origins are unknown; physically, he resembles one of the Dark Elves who make their home in the forest, but in manner he is more akin to the monstrous insects which lair in its deepest recesses. These creatures are the most powerful and dangerous inhabitants of the forest, whatever the Dark Elves tell themselves. Even the strongest of Demonspawn would hesitate to attract their predatory attention, and Ruel is their servant. \r\n\r\nRuel is a freakish caricature of the Dark Elves who inhabit the forest. While he moves with grace, it is not the grace of an Elf but something insectoid and alien. His voice lacks the Elvish mellifluousness, and is instead a gurgling croak. Beneath his curious armor, his body is hardened like an insect’s carapace, and his gaze is unsettling, even to the most hardened Ranger. In his hands, he carries a bow resembling the husk of an insect, twisted into the shape of a weapon. \r\n\r\nHe first appeared not long after the Dark Elves decided to make Durham Forest their home. The Elves had begun to encroach upon the forest’s heart and Ruel emerged to greet one party with a message from the things that lurked there: cease, or be punished. The Elves laughed; they were not intimidated by this gangly stranger, with his curious way of speaking. They had seen worse things, they claimed. The forest was theirs, they declared. Whatever its original inhabitants thought of that was immaterial. \r\n\r\nRuel swiftly punished those Elves for their temerity. Some fell to the arrows he fired from his strange, insect-shaped bow, while others perished to the claws and mandibles of the horrid insects that flowed from the forest at Ruel’s gesture. Nor were these the last Dark Elves to meet such a fate. Ruel’s attacks continued until the Dark Elves retreated from the heart of the forest, abandoning their settlements there. These places were quickly retaken by the forest, swallowed up by weeds, vines, and moss, or else shrouded in vast swathes of spiderweb. If they exist now, it is only as spider-haunted ruins. \r\n\r\nAfter that, Ruel vanished. Dark Elf Rangers reported seeing him on occasion, as they scouted the farthest edges of explored territory, though he made no move to interact with them, a fact that most viewed with relief. But sightings of him became more common as the bloody events of his initial appearance faded from common memory and the Dark Elves sought to expand the limits of their new domain once more. \r\n\r\nMore than one unlucky Ranger vanished into the gloom, taken, it was said, by the Huntmaster. Settlements, too, disappeared; some were devoured by swarms of ravenous insects, while others were suffocated beneath thick blankets of clinging webbing. Again, the Dark Elves retreated, but not for long. Ambition, hubris, and the need to expand drove them back into the wild places again and again. And with every expedition, Ruel was there waiting for them. \r\n\r\nThis state of events has continued to the present day. The Dark Elves are ever pushing the boundaries of their realm deeper into the forest, and Ruel is always there to counter them in brutal fashion. He rarely speaks, save to deliver a warning that is almost never heeded. More than once, the Dark Elves have attempted to waylay or capture Ruel, but never with any success. The forest itself seems to protect him, and he is always accompanied by swarms of great insects. \r\n\r\nThis constant back and forth has led to much debate among the Dark Elves on the origins of their foe. Some maintain that Ruel was once a child of their race, stolen away by the things living in the deep forest, the ancient creatures ensnaring the boy in a fell cocoon and tending him after the fashion of their own hideous offspring. What emerged was something that was neither completely insect nor Elf, but a horrific amalgamation of the two. \r\n\r\nOthers claim that Ruel was never an Elf at all. That he was and is nothing more than an insect, twisted into a somewhat familiar shape, in order to better communicate the wishes of his dread masters. \r\n\r\nRegardless, Ruel’s purpose is clear to even the dimmest mind. He is an emissary and mouthpiece for the horrors lurking in the deep forest; a tool shaped and designed by the insects. Through him, their will is made known to those who they regard as tenants at best and trespassers at worst. And failure to heed him leads only to death and despair.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=5990#static": "The Knight of the Sun is among the most instantly recognizable and widely known of the Banner Lords, though some know him as a hero and others as an embarrassing fop. Some see Helior’s dazzlingly expensive full regalia to represent every outrageous extravagance and inflated ego among all the other lords, even the Knight of Knights who rules over them. Those native to Kaerok tend to look more fondly on him, and point out that though he may display his devotion with great flourish, he is at heart a pious and learned man, if a bit obsessive. One thing that none can deny is that he has an incomparable style.\r\n\r\nCriticisms of Helior often begin with the fact that he is a titular count. This is to say that he is the inheritor of a county that, due to some combination of internal politics, wars, and marriages, no longer corresponds to any physical land. Though defunct, the title still retains historical claims and ancestral rights, and so must persist as a legal entity within the cryptic bureaucracy of the Banner Lords. Because they do not administer a fiefdom, titular lords often pursue full-time military service or venture abroad. But Helior prefers a sort of mendicant lifestyle, disdaining servants and even permanent residences. He most frequently makes libraries and monasteries his destination, and has studied extensively in the lands of the Sacred Order. He stops at holy sites both famous and obscure, inquiring about relics and sometimes buying them with portions of his family fortune, kept on his person in the form of gold coins of very old mintage. The common thread that binds all of his endeavors is, predictably, the Sun of Teleria, as well as wisdom related to astronomy and the movements of stars. The stated goal of all his travels and scholarship is to travel close to the Sun or set foot upon it, or else study it from afar with such scrutiny as to determine its true nature. \r\n\r\nTo critics this is the folly of a mad nobleman whose funds and strength at arms would be better used for the good of the realm, especially considering that in his endeavors Helior has shown remarkable skill with his halberd and mastery of several unique solar incantations. Though he does not live as a professional warrior, he rarely goes untested for long, because in the course of his wanderings he often diverts to challenge himself against a local menace in need of smiting – lip service to the idea of Lordship, perhaps, or a genuine good-faith effort to improve the state of the world. Either way, battle is not his primary focus. Nonetheless it is usually seen as a minor boon for the Knight of the Sun to be passing through one’s hamlet. Children delight at his awesome appearance, and sometimes whole villages grind to a halt to pause and gawk when he passes. He does not stop to give lectures but will gladly discourse on his favorite subject all the same, and sometimes leads a procession of interested listeners as he saunters on foot towards his next objective. On occasion Helior has been confused for another flash spender of coin, the warrior Septimus. He minds not the confusion, citing that on his journeys, he has encountered many a knight who would be a much worse comparison.\r\n\r\nBut what of his goal, mad or sane as it may be? In the course of studying and seeking the Sun, Helior has gained keen theological insights as to its resplendent nature. According to his accumulated lore, in the distant past during the Primordial Age that birthed Teleria, the Sun was a thing of pure Light, indistinguishable from that of the Goddess Lumaya herself. But Light undiluted cannot long coexist with the mortal world, and its nature begins to change, becoming mixed with the terrestrial essence of the created world on which it shines. When the gods were sealed off from Teleria by virtue of a great banishment spell at the close of this Age, the Sun shone on with Light that was no longer wholly Lumaya’s, but of Teleria and its principia. Though divinely seeded, the light that nourishes crops and warms the land is entangled with the branches of natural philosophy that govern such things. Since the Sun is the closest known link to Lumaya and her luminous realm beyond, in studying it one may glean some knowledge of the lingering essence of the Divine, and move all living things one step closer to ultimate understanding. \r\n\r\nFew could imagine that this glitzy, jolly nobleman with the generous coin purse seeks such an esoteric goal.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6000#static": "The Lizardmen once ruled the almost all of Teleria. Their realm was called the Empire of Dragons, and they themselves were called the Dragonkin. They were a proud, strong people, and their histories stretched so far back into the depths of time that they speak of the Gods as people who walked among them, rather than as abstract icons of worship. It must have seemed impossible that something so ancient and unchanging could be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Empire of Dragons was sudden. The wrath of Siroth came upon it with such violence that it wiped the empire's home archipelago of Torcelin Istriv clean of all traces of civilization. The annihilation of the two Imperial capitals – Allreach, buried by molten rock, and Twinrift, drowned by the sea – left what little remained of imperial authority to languish and fragment. Within a few decades, even the suzerains who ruled the far-flung colonial provinces were gone, and the Dragonkin engulfed themselves in civil war. Those who remained turned their backs on their heritage, declaring themselves the kin of nothing more than lizards.\r\n\r\nPrince Ramantu, the one they called the Drakesblood, lived to witness all of it. He lived to see the future of the Empire of Dragons slip through his fingers and turn to dust, no matter how desperately he tried to save it.\r\n\r\nThere are few records of Ramantu Drakesblood still surviving into the modern day. He is spoken of as a legend by the Lizardmen of the Sorrowlakes, though the tales of him vary and contradict. Some believe he is not real, or that he was corrupt and was the cause of half the evil that he tried to overcome. Others blame him for the Sin of Dragons – those few who even know the name, if not what it was – while still others blame him for the civil war that followed. A few remember that he fought in the First Great War, but the magnitude of his accomplishments there is mostly forgotten. Most Lizardmen simply remember him as the last Prince of the Dragonkin, and curse his name with the same bitter resentment as they curse the rest of the Empire's memory.\r\n\r\nIt is the last group that Ramantu has most sympathy for. The details are wrong, he would say, but the sentiment is well deserved. He curses his own memory, too, on occasion, but it was all more than a thousand years ago, and, as one of the Arbiter’s first-ever Champions, he has greater enemies to fight than false historical records.\r\n\r\nRamantu’s Shard gave him immortality, but the Arbiter gave him a reason to live. Those very few who know the Arbiter well say that Ramantu is the name she calls when she faces an enemy, a trial, or a defeat too insurmountable for even her to overcome. It is a name she calls when all around her would betray her. A name she calls when she has lost hope. They say that the Arbiter has a billion wards, a million soldiers, a thousand allies, a dozen equals, but only one true friend. Of all her Champions, only a precious few would she ever draw from their Shards just to speak, share a glass of wine, and her secret fears with. Of all his life's achievements, it is that friendship that Ramantu Drakesblood values most – the rest, he would say, is dust and regret, and like time and the Arbiter, he marches onward.\r\n\r\nOr he would, if he could. The Arbiter has not called Ramantu from his Shard in centuries. It is not only her weakness of magic that restrains her from speaking to her friend and ally, but also weakness of spirit. The Teleria that Ramantu fought so hard for centuries before has been all but lost to corruption and strife, all under the Arbiter’s watch. If she had the power to summon Ramantu, it is not clear she would use it, for that reason.\r\n\r\nIf the Arbiter's power ever returns, though – or if another is imbued with enough strength to aid her – then Siroth and his Demonspawn will have much to fear. For, in the great many years since the Sin of Dragons, Ramantu Drakesblood has taught them all a painful lesson: when they stand against the Last Prince of the Dragonkin, they will taste defeat. No matter their strength.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6040#static": "When the Fae fled to eastern Peltas during the distant days of the Awakening, not all settled in the primordial forest that became known as the Mistwood. Some made new homes for themselves on the edge of the neighboring Cloudspire Mountains, amid snowy peaks and dark, craggy gullies. Among them was the Fae who would become known as Genbo the Dishonored.\r\n\r\nThought of by his fellow Fae as stony and unsmiling, Genbo found his personality well suited to the unyielding and lonely mountaintops. He built a home there, often assuming the form of a great condor to sweep over the land. Though ennobled within the Fae Court as the Prince of the Peaks, he spent little time among his own kind, instead teaching eagle chicks how to fly, tutoring the mountain winds to sing, and forging two swords from the deepest ore, claiming that the soul of the Cloudspires imbued the blades with crushing weight every time he struck with them.\r\n\r\nGenbo would likely have been content to see out many ages in solitude, but it was not to be. Yakai, while not as filled with unrest as it had been during the rule of the Mikage, was in the Age of Ruin still prone to bouts of localized lawlessness, while the Dwarves of the neighboring peaks had abandoned their isolation and were now expanding their holdings. Worst of all to him, the Mistwood Fae were becoming increasingly looking to expand the boundaries of their forest. The Rhythm of the great forest was becoming unsettling. Genbo had a keen sense of justice, and it seemed as though his kind were straying down a dark path.\r\n\r\nRealizing that to remain isolated would only see him overtaken by events, Genbo took flight and made a rare appearance in the Fae court in Nyresa. He tried to convince the ministers to take a less militaristic stance, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Even worse, when he returned to the mountains he found his Fae kin there preparing for outright war. They intended to attack a Dwarf mining operation that had displaced a large number of their kind.\r\n\r\nGenbo refused to be an aggressor, claiming that there was no nobility in choosing war over diplomacy. The Fae’s attack was a disaster, and in the aftermath they sought a scapegoat. Genbo was seized and accused of cowardice and betrayal. He refused to legitimize the court by mounting any defense, being as silent and unyielding as his mountain home. He was sentenced to a punishment no less cruel than death. His great wings were hacked off, and he was exiled, forbidden from ever returning to the mountain peaks he had grown to love. \r\n\r\nGenbo accepted his sentence without comment and complaint. Despite his resilience, it took a deep toll on Genbo’s psyche. Known now by the Fae as Genbo the Dishonored, he traveled into Yakai, where he journeyed aimlessly for a time, becoming a grim and sorrowful fable in the stories of the Humans there.\r\n\r\nWhile the pain of his severed wings never left him, with time Genbo rediscovered some purpose. He knew isolation was no longer feasible – he had been cast from his home, and there was no option other than to go out into the world. Disdaining his supposed dishonor, he began to journey across Yakai, seeking to protect those suffering from bandit predation or the cruelties of unjust lords. He searches still for a purpose outside of solitude, something to convince himself that the shame and sorrow he has buried deep within himself may yet flourish into something meaningful.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6050#static": "Burangiri, infamous throughout Yakai as the Soulmonger, was once known as the Boar King and Master of the Rampage. Born among the Fae of the Mistwood, he quickly acquired a position at the Fae Court that involved protecting the Sylvan realm from interlopers and corruption. Like many Fae, he is capable of shifting his form, and in his early years often assumed the guise of a huge, tusked boar.\r\n\r\nWhile Fae are sometimes imagined as effete, mercurial creatures, Burangiri’s attitude was always more brutish and simple. He delighted in breaking and sundering things with his thick skull or horns, and other Fae came to view him as nature’s wilder and most untamable elements given form, a roving beast-spirit of the forest. Like a cyclone or a summer storm, Burangiri would shatter old, ailing trees to clear the way for new life, or plough up and mulch the woodland floor. The Fae Court put him to work driving out unclean spirits and interlopers, setting the Boar King loose on those not welcome within the Mistwood’s borders. In this way he aided the Sylvan Watchers and did his part to preserve the Mistwood and its Rhythm.\r\n\r\nThings changed when a Dark Elf sorcerer named Lameth made the Mistwood his new home. Lameth had been exiled from Durham, and sought a new deep wood to make as his lair. Burangiri’s stampeding soon put a stop to the Dark Elf’s schemes. He trampled Lameth, but as he did so, Burangiri did more than merely destroy Lameth’s body. As the Dark Elf’s life essence left his broken body, Burangiri’s mane of blue flames snared it, and he found himself able to devour the incorporeal spirit before it dissipated. Such a meal filled him for a while with an unstoppable energy, adding to his already bountiful strength and vigor, and he found the taste of soul essence exquisite.  \r\n\r\nBurangiri repeated his consuming act with another invader of the forest, and another. He grew addicted to the devouring, his body becoming lit by spectral blue soul flames, his need to feast growing ever-greater. He found himself relishing the power derived from consuming souls far more than he would any regular meal, eventually using it as his only source of sustenance. The more dark beings he gorged on, the more his own mind and form became twisted.\r\n\r\nOther Fae were not ignorant of the changes Burangiri was undergoing. As his rampages became more fraught and unpredictable, he was summoned before the Fae Court. They banished him from the Mistwood, saying he could not return until he had learned to tame his hunger, a decree that initially enraged him. Try as he might though, he could not break the arcane wards put upon him that kept him outside of the Mistwood’s borders.\r\n\r\nFrustrated, the hulking Fae set out into Yakai, determined to overcome his need to feast on a diet of foul souls. His struggle continues, and at times he succumbs. His legend has become renowned throughout Yakai, where he takes on a hulking form bearing a skull-mask framed by the blazing soul fires of those he has consumed.\r\n\r\nOne wise woman of Yakai’s high hills has prophesied that only through good deeds can Burangiri drain the evil he has consumed and find the abstinence he craves. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but there are many dark spirits within Yakai, a legacy of the brutal reign of the Mikage, and Burangiri pursues them with the same relentlessness that he once showed driving corruption from the Mistwood.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6080#static": "While some claim that parts of Dwarven civilization stagnated during their self-imposed isolation, their mechanical ingenuity only flourished. Over countless generations, the Dwarves perfected their craft, combining engineering and arcane science to gain dominance over earth and metal alike. Some mechanists focused on designing tiny, beautiful clockwork machines, while others built titanic, lumbering engines, capable of moving giant quantities of earth and ore to help prospectors in their endless mining of the mountains. The latter was especially prevalent in the Skyiron Dominion, where molten iron and bronze flow in great rivers, feeding the Dominion's great foundries. Hundreds of Dwarves toil in the stifling heat of these factories to this day, blending metal and runescript to craft fearsome weapons. Whether it's nigh impenetrable suits of armor, razor sharp axes, or sturdy iron ships, everything is overseen by the Dominion’s Supreme Engineer.\r\n\r\nUnlike their compatriots in Gloomdeep Hold, the Dwarves of the Skyiron Dominion welcomed the outside world much more readily after they recovered from the Demonspawn invasion of their lands, quickly becoming a bustling hub of technological advancement. Shipwrights, blacksmiths, and metallurgists from across the world flocked to learn from Skyiron craftsmen, often exchanging their own knowledge of magic and manufacturing with their Dwarven tutors. Over the years, the Dwarves married their sacred runescript with magic from across Teleria, pushing the limits of technology beyond anything seen before. Under the watchful eye of Hurndig, the current Supreme Engineer, the Dominion’s creations have become the pinnacle of magical innovation.\r\n\r\nFew Supreme Engineers have earned such good repute as Hurndig. His journey began when he was singled out by the Metalworkers’ Guild at a young age. Under their guidance, Hurndig dedicated his life to the art of the mechanist. But Hurndig’s view of his craft differed from his fellow Dwarves. Though he put the needs of his homeland first, Hurndig knew that his inventions had the power to improve the lives of all people in Teleria. They needed to be shared with all, not hidden in some dark manufactory like the way a dragon hoards their treasure. Despite this generosity, he has kept a few of his inventions for himself, the most powerful of which is his massive forge hammer. Hurndig’s hammer is the result of blending ancient Dragonkin research and the oldest Dwarven runes, creating something that has the power to slow the passage of time for anything struck by it. He has also conducted experiments with rudimentary firearms – using the power of runescript, advanced metallurgy, and specialist fire magic, these prototype weapons create explosions to propel projectiles over long distances.\r\n\r\nTo this day, Hurndig continues to engineer new machines and devices that will help push Teleria's technological boundaries. Some within the Skyiron Dominion detest Hurndig sharing his gifts outside his kin, but he is resolute. His creations are to be used by all, as far as he is concerned – as long as they are used to lift the world from its ruined state.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6090#static": "When the Mikage Autocracy was overthrown, the people of Yakai could finally look forward to a new future, one that was no longer ruled by fear and brutality. And while the lot of many of the common people certainly improved, the same could not be said for everyone. The Autocracy’s collapse was far from a clean or simple affair, and the idealistic beliefs that some of the rebels had fought for, that revolved around the absolute destruction of the Mikage and the creation of a freer and more open society, were not fully realized.\r\n\r\nThe new order was not one championed by Lady Kimi. The descendant of an aristocratic Yakai family that had held power before the rise of the Mikage, Kimi had fought alongside the rebellion, and assumed that the lands and authority stolen from her forebears by the Mikage would be returned following the defeat of the servants of Siroth.\r\n\r\nBut that was not to be. While the many Demonspawn who comprised much of the Autocracy’s upper echelons were executed following the rebellion’s victory, not all of the Mikage were marked for death. The more pragmatic faction within the victorious rebellion believed that the administrators and minor commanders who had run the Autocracy were still required if a stable society was to emerge from the ashes of war. Because of this, many of the lesser Mikage bureaucrats were pardoned and allowed to continue certain administrative duties. Among those spared was Lau Shey, a Mikage crony who had been given Kimi’s lands and estates by the previous regime.\r\n\r\nTo her outrage, Kimi found that Yakai’s new leaders were unwilling to return her property to her. Even worse, she found that a number of her allies within the rebellion, many of whom tended to believe none of the Mikage should be spared, were mysteriously disappearing or suffering unexplained ‘accidents’. Kimi quickly became convinced that the triumphant rebellion was murdering former allies who disagreed with the new direction, and that in a sense the emerging regime was now just as bad as the Autocracy. She resolved to strike back, but knew she could not do so alone.\r\n\r\nKimi established herself on the borderlands close to the Mistwood, an area populated by many of those now distrustful of the rebellion because of its distance from Yakai's heartlands. Finding allies proved difficult however, until Kimi was visited by several Sylvan Fae. They had somehow become aware of the unrest Kimi was seeking to foment. They offered to assist her, even grant her magical blessings if, when she regained her proper station, she agreed to give certain boons to them, and advance their cause within the Dawnlands. Though the Sylvan had provided invaluable aid to the rebellion, some of their number were maneuvering to take advantage of Yakai's new freedom to further exert their influence.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with their unknowable ways, many of the Fae’s terms were strange and unsettling. They wished for, among other things, Kimi’s left eye, and her second-born child, if ever she had one. The Yakai noblewoman suppressed her distress at their demands, for her determination to right what she saw as the wrongs that were besetting her knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nKimi accepted the Fae’s terms. Upon this, they attuned her to the Rhythm and granted her powers that subtly set her apart from the mere mortal she had once been. Her appearance became more youthful, her body filled with fresh vitality. Those she met, especially the common folk, were easily enthralled by her words and beauty. A Fae glamor hung about her, one that she swiftly turned to her advantage. The Fae had also implanted short, magical horns into her scalp, and wove their spells like gossamer into the flower heraldry that decorated her armor and cloak, allowing them to guide her and follow her activities even from afar.\r\n\r\nLady Kimi set about recruiting for her cause, working especially to attract those idealists who had survived the rebellion’s apparent cull. She promoted the idea that those who now controlled Yakai were little better than the Autocracy that came before, even giving time to a conspiratorial belief that the former rebellion’s upper echelons had themselves secretly fallen in league with Siroth. In truth Kimi is the one with secret masters, for while Fae rarely journey beyond the Mistwood, her allies use her as their agent. They, and the driving pulse of the Rhythm, drive Kimi to push her power and influence further.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion Kimi has been stirring is not yet open, for she does not intend to strike before she feels victory is assured. Her first effort will surely be to reclaim her old domains, after which she will challenge Yakai’s rulers to try to take her lands back. Until the day she is ready, she travels Peltas and the eastern Lost Isles, seeking more allies and, unwittingly, spreading the Fae’s influence beyond the Dawnlands.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6100#static": "Nobel is the Golden Serpent, the Voice of Yakai, an emissary of the Shadowkin whose deeds stretch all the way back to the time of the kings of the Dawnlands. His counsel is always heeded, and his grim presence has struck fear and awe into prince and pauper alike for half a millennium.\r\n\r\nNobel began his life in service. Born to a mid-ranking retainer serving a Dawnlander clan king, he seemed destined for a similarly unremarkable role. That was until he was assigned to serve the son of King Kanri, Tenshi. The prince was a mercurial and headstrong young man who got into all manner of scrapes unbecoming of his position, from avoiding paying his gambling dues to dalliances with the daughters of rival clans. Nobel was commanded to make excuses for Tenshi at every turn. While he did not approve of most of the prince's antics, as a youth barely older than him, Nobel was often caught up in the reckless excitement that Tenshi exuded. The two developed something of a friendship, and Tenshi came to trust Nobel’s discretion completely.\r\n\r\nThis stood Nobel in good stead when Tenshi inherited rulership of the clan. Nobel was granted the title of ‘harbinger,’ assuming the role of Tenshi’s herald. Tenshi’s policies were expansionist and aggressive, and it fell to Nobel to strong-arm rival clans into obedience or deliver declarations of war and ultimatums for surrender. He quickly became a figure of fear and loathing. For his own part, he greatly enjoyed the cut-and-thrust of diplomacy, and the power that his authority gave him. \r\n\r\nWhen the Mikage Autocracy rose to power in Yakai, Tenshi showed little hesitation before swearing himself to it. To the clan king, the Autocracy represented an opportunity to exert influence and control over all of the Dawnlands. Through Tenshi, Nobel therefore became one of the Autocracy’s emissaries, his own power and influence growing as his master’s did.\r\n\r\nTenshi accepted the boon of Demonhood when it was offered to him. Nobel did not follow immediately, for while his allegiance to Tenshi and the Mikage was without question, he did not wholly trust the new Demonic nobility. But the march of time was ruthless, and as Nobel grew older the lure of immortality became too great. He joined the ranks of the Demonspawn, assuming a terrible, pallid visage twinned with the coiling golden serpents that were the old symbol of his Dawnlander clan.\r\n\r\nNobel continued to act as a herald for the Mikage, his duties expanding beyond the service of just Tenshi to encompass other Autocracy leaders and armies. As his power and influence continued to build his dedication to the role slowly eclipsed all else. It was a task that now defined him, and Nobel showed no emotion when word reached him that Tenshi had been struck down by assassins sent by the growing rebellion gripping Yakai. After four centuries in service to the Autocracy, the old bond between the clan prince and his servant was long gone. \r\n\r\nNobel’s own high standing in the Autocracy made him a prime target for the rebellion as well, and when the assassins came he proved he was no mere diplomat. The power of Siroth had invested him with more than mere immortality or Demonic cunning, for his strength and speed were now far beyond that of the old man he had once been. He cut down the assassins. None would interrupt his duties.\r\n\r\nGradually, the tide of war turned against the Mikage. As the Autocracy began to collapse, Nobel was captured, and dragged before the leaders of the rebellion. It was a common belief that such a staunch symbol of Mikage rule would be granted a public execution. Nobel had a proposal however, one which took his enemies by surprise. Though he served the Mikage, he had never devised their cruel policies, led their armies, or conducted their tortures. His existence was dedicated to the life of a herald, an emissary of Yakai. Now that the rebellion was close to victory, he was willing to serve the new regime just as he had the Mikage, and Tenshi before them. He could give them some form of legitimacy among those who still backed the Autocracy with wavering loyalties, and could use his abilities to persuade others of his time and kind to surrender.\r\n\r\nThough some of the rebellion still called for Nobel’s head, others saw the reason in what he claimed. Besides, other Mikage leaders had been spared, and Nobel’s defection to the rebels was a further marker of their triumph. Nobel’s proposal was accepted, and a new chapter in the existence of the infamous Voice of Yakai began, one that would see him representing the interests of the Shadowkin all across Teleria.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6120#static": "The Siegehulks are among the most infamous of all Ogryn-kind. Regarded with pity and fear, they have earned a reputation as destroyers and desecrators, and their appearance stirs terror in the heart of the garrisons that the Siegehulks plan to assault.\r\n\r\nThe origins of the Siegehulks are said to lie in the latter years of the Gaellen conflict, when the Warclave resolved to attain victory at any price. Sieges have always been a difficult proposition to an attacking force, costly in time, material, and lives most of all. In such circumstances, Ogryn have always made effective shock troops. Strong, tough, and rarely questioning orders, they became the go-to stormers and breachers for Gaellen Pact armies during the grueling Gaellen War.\r\n\r\nThe Warclave took that a step further. The size of Ogryn meant they could be used as mounts for heavy, bolt-launching ballistae, turning what would otherwise have been static artillery, mobile. The Warclave realized that rather than use the weapons to bombard fortifications from afar, these Ogryn could carry them in with the assault, providing close support to the storm party. To this end they were equipped not only with a back-mounted ballistae, but also with heavy plate, chain armor, and hefty pig-iron helms, allowing them to endure the fiercest of attacks while continuing their own destructive efforts.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this, the Warclave added more. The ballistae were not simply mounted on the backs of the Siegehulks, but were fused with their spines by sorcery, turning them into true, living weapons. Magical imperatives were used to infest their minds with the repetitive thunder of war drums, slaving their will to nothing but their weapons and the purpose of the siege.\r\n\r\nSiegehulks are still created to this day, their lives almost invariably short – they rarely speak or interact with fellow Ogryn and rarely remove their helmets. Even so, there are some whose exploits are so brutal that despite their near-anonymity, they have won renown. One such Siegehulk striding across Teleria in the Age of Ruin is known as Wall-Doom.\r\n\r\nIt was Wall-Doom who continued the relentless barrage that eventually wrecked the White Citadel, an Aravian stronghold in western Peltas. While the blinding elemental magics that helped protect the Citadel made the siege difficult, Wall-Doom continued to launch bolt after bolt, day and night, never stopping to rest or to eat or converse, all the time ignoring how the magics of the fortress burned his eyes. When most of the Elven stronghold was reduced to rubble and its sorceries were a mere glimmer, its garrison surrendered.\r\n\r\nOther stories tell of Wall-Doom’s victory at Castle Fronchard. After running out of ammunition, the Siegehulk simply charged the main gate and began beating at it with his helmeted head, ignoring the arrows and boiling oil poured onto him by the defenders. Castle Fronchard broke before Wall-Doom, and the Ogryn led the assault through the splintered entrance.\r\n\r\nAt Black Crag, Wall-Doom launched the bolt that slew Arch-Sorcerer Ozimandu, while at Red Run Ford he held the Orc chieftain Skorndax beneath the river’s flow, ignoring the powerful brute’s blows until the warlord drowned. There is no record of just why Wall-Doom fights without relent and in this regard, he is an example of the Siegehulk condition, for it seems that the war drums that beat constantly in his head have driven out all else. All that remains is battle.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6200#static": "Most of those who live beyond the borders of Yakai consider the Ninja a mere confabulation, a propaganda piece designed to aggrandize the superhuman capabilities of some Shadowkin. Some say they have witnessed the brilliant azure glow of the Ninja, but never seen his face, so quick and nimble were his movements. The few scattered reports have been dismissed as unreliable. The rest of Teleria sleeps all the more soundly at night believing the Ninja to be a series of coincidences and exaggerations.\r\n\r\nBut for the Shadowkin, there is no uncertainty as to the Ninja and his greatness. He is the hero of countless poems and songs. Depictions of his adventures adorn the walls of palaces and taverns alike, and news of his latest exploits are eagerly awaited in hamlets, towns, and the very corridors of power. So elaborate and spectacular are his alleged triumphs that even his greatest fanatics find their credulity sometimes strained. But such is the nature of the folk hero. Critics dismiss everything wholesale, but believers are convinced there is more truth than lies to the heroic sagas. \r\n\r\nMost likely, the Ninja is a highly atypical example of the Mikage Demonspawn, based on the single wing that grows from his shoulder, but that is simply the least-outlandish of the theories. His tale begins as a foundling infant who appeared before the acolytes of the Charn-Yo Proving Ground, one of the most prestigious centers of martial arts in Yakai and indeed all the world. Charn-Yo warriors are taught to blend spirit and muscle in pursuit of an ultimate fighting technique theorized by the grandmasters but never truly achieved. The strange babe appeared in a flash, his locks a brilliant blue hue unlike any had ever seen, with such an otherworldly aspect to him that the students were awed by it and even the elders were intrigued.\r\n\r\nHe was raised by the disciples of Charn-Yo, and grew to consider the whole school his family. He picked up new techniques quickly, his appetite for new skills and knowledge endless. In the sparring ring he insisted on full-contact practice against opponents far superior to him, enduring blow after blow to toughen his body and his will, refusing to give up or to allow his mentors to go easy on him. When he was too bruised and battered to continue to practice the sword, he rose and proceeded to the target range, where he would take up a bow and a satchel of throwing knives and work on his aim. He was not a perfect pupil, for at times he was wilful and petulant as all young men sometimes are. His occasional pranks were legendary themselves. But no one could deny his skill and fitness, and soon his masters knew that he was their best chance yet to realize the true potential of the Charn-Yo arts.\r\n\r\nNinja was taught to tap into his own life-force, his fighting spirit, his ego, his charisma, all the things that fueled him with a will to greatness. To turn excitement and eagerness into raw energy, to give fiery life to that potential energy within – this was the ultimate fighting art that Ninja’s mentors had theorized about long before. They had searched for ages for a pupil with the potential to finally bring the art to full fruition, and they saw Ninja as their best opportunity yet. The road was long and hard. He struggled, but built his confidence, and when he first was able to wreath his sword in his own brilliant blue spirit-energy, he erupted with joy. With his mastery of blade and bow, he created his own fighting style, manifesting the flaming soul of the weapons themselves and enhancing each slash and shot with his own inimitable power. \r\n\r\nHis former mentors and all the pupils of Charn-Yo bade Ninja a fond farewell, for there was nothing left to teach him, only his example for them to follow. As to what he did next, one need only ask around at any teahouse or farmstead in Yakai to hear a dozen tales of the Ninja. He annihilated the entire Mountain Stream Viper Gang in a single night, shot the Winged Horror of Dilwan from the sky, and rescued trapped survivors of the Flooding of the Jonban with his great strength and agility. He seems to prioritize spectacle, challenge, and personal satisfaction when deciding on what deed of heroism to perform next. They say he is making history even now, and every rumormonger in the land has their eyes and ears tuned to find new traces of his famed feats of martial prowess.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6210#static": "Renowned for their ferocity, the Orc clans that roam the fringes of Durham Forest have long established themselves as a menace to those who encounter them. They prey on travelers as brigands, or fight as mercenaries for those who can afford their services. Among the bandit companies was that of a vicious Orc called Varl. Leading an alliance of Orcs and Skinwalkers, his infamy grew with every village he put to the torch and every merchant convoy he destroyed with his burning blades.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Varl's authority over his company seemed unshakable, until a chance meeting with an enigmatic Dark Elf mage. Seducing Varl with gold and information on trade caravans moving between Kaerok and Aravia, the Dark Elf gained the Orc chieftain's trust – and then shattered it. He charmed the Skinwalkers under Varl's command so that they would obey his will and become his slaves, and ordered them to mutiny. In a fit of bestial rage, they abandoned their posts and darted deep into Durham Forest with him. Enraged by this deception, Varl ordered the remains of his band to hunt them all down. They plunged deep into the twisted woods, hellbent on cutting down the Elf and the traitors.\r\n\r\nVarl followed the trail like a ravenous wolf. It was as if a red mist had descended upon him as he tore through thickets and brambles. But his rage was tempered by his intelligence, his desire to kill the one who betrayed him matched by his keen tactical mind. As his band gained ground on the traitors, Varl had them diverge from the trail, to overtake them and their puppet-master while out of sight. They surrounded their quarry at what seemed to be an abandoned Dark Elf briar-den. Surrounded and desperate, the Elven mage chanted a dark blessing, and imbued his mesmerized Skinwalkers with unnatural speed, strength, and ferocity. An exhausting and bloody battle ensued – with their new, supernatural boons, the Skinwalkers ripped apart their former allies, and the Elf wove spell after spell to regenerate any wounds the Orcs inflicted upon them in turn. Varl realized that if he did not act soon, his remaining warriors would be destroyed.\r\n\r\nRaising his blazing weapons aloft, Varl torched the surrounding trees, hoping the spreading fire would claim his enemies. The flames tore through the forest, adding greatly to the chaos. In the frantic melee, which quickly descended into a vicious panic, Varl hacked down a pair of frothing Skinwalkers in quick succession before charging the Dark Elf, his rage taking over his mind as the growing inferno swirled around him. His ferocity and muscled bulk made him no match for the mage, who he swiftly beheaded. The severed head rolled into the flames, and its pale skin was soon charred. Varl recovered it, and held the Elf's charred head aloft, letting out a great battle cry before ordering his remaining – and heavily wounded – warriors to retreat.\r\n\r\nThe blaze’s results went far beyond what Varl had intended. Though the briar-den had appeared abandoned, many Dark Elves lived in the trees above. When the flames erupted, the Elves fled their burning homes, enraged by the destruction and the invasion of their territory. As Varl and his band fled, the Dark Elves fell upon them, bows nocked with venom-tipped arrows and bearing long, wicked blades. They slew dozens of exhausted and completely surprised Orcs in minutes. Knowing victory was impossible, Varl ran, not slowing until he left the forest and reached the plains he and his band once roamed. Only then did he look back, as blood flowed from his many wounds. Only a handful of limping Orcs and Skinwalkers emerged from the trees, and he saw several struck down with black-fletched arrows just as they thought they had reached some kind of safety. As plumes of smoke billowed into the darkening sky, Varl watched the battered remnants of his company scatter. He was too exhausted, and too ashamed, to call after them.\r\n\r\nIt was only after that Varl earned his epithet of ‘the Destroyer’ – for bringing destruction not only to a swathe of Durham Forest, but to the band he had led.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6220#static": "Many a bard favors songs of good and just kings whose hearts bleed for the woes of their people. But alas, not every king is worthy of such tales. Such was King Versulf, called the Grim for his lack of humor when he was young – and for darker reasons once he was older.\r\n\r\nOnce, he ruled the Free City of Arnoc, ascending the throne at a young age after his father was killed during the War of the Elves. Versulf was paranoid, temperamental, and hungry for conquest. He pursued aggressive adventures against his neighbors – the newly entrenched Dark Elves of Durham Forest, the nearby Orc and Ogryn clans still clinging on after the Red Crusade, and even his own weaker allies in the Kingdom of Kaerok. To wage these wars, he bled his people dry with taxes and levies. Despite furious protests among peasants, nobles, and burghers alike, Versulf was unmoved. He feared no enemy, whether foreign or domestic. Only one thing scared him – death itself. He had witnessed his father’s long, cruel end suffering from grievously infected wounds. He had heard his mother’s screams as she died giving birth to his stillborn sister. He had watched hangings, beheadings, poisonings, mutilations, and torture. Even peaceful deaths had given Versulf nightmares. He had been forced to stand vigil over the corpse of both his grandfathers in his youth. If there was a way to avoid death – any way – he was very much open to learning more.\r\n\r\nAs Versulf grew older, he traveled to nearby Narbuk – home of the Church of Lumaya – to seek counsel. The High Cleric was useless to him, providing only platitudes and naysaying talk of ‘acceptance’, but Versulf also met with a powerful Sacred Order inquisitor called K'Leth. The inquisitor had answers where all others offered excuses, and he revealed a plan to Versulf that would allow them both to evade death forever – a cycle of endless rebirth. But, K'Leth warned, it would be dangerous, and would require... certain resources. Versulf was only too happy to provide them.\r\n\r\nIn Arnoc, the vanishings began with the poor and the homeless. Only non-Human survivors of the Red Crusade disappeared at first, but that limitation was not in place long. People began to fear ghosts, killers, or even a return of the Skinwalker Plague. Others spoke of masked men who stalked the city streets at night, with carriages waiting nearby to receive their wriggling cargo. It took years for the truth to become suggested, then known. The Night Watch, they were called – the king's flesh thieves. It was only a matter of time before the Sacred Order took note, but certain events plunged the situation over the edge.\r\n\r\nWhen the corruption of Narbuk was uncovered and the Lumayan Church fell, a host of the Sacred Order came to the city and razed it. The Mage-Barons that K'Leth called his oldest allies fled in droves, spreading the influence of the Cult of K'Leth around the world. Many of K’Leth’s allies fled to nearby Arnoc, with a now elderly Versulf accepting them with open arms. The Sacred Order was not far behind. The ashes of Narbuk had barely cooled when a Sacred Order army arrived at Arnoc, demanding entry. This gave the impetus for the city’s oppressed people to rise up against the city guard and the Night Watch, and they threw open the gates and broke into the citadel at Arnoc’s heart alongside Order warriors. Versulf's elite soldiers were overwhelmed, and the Sacred Order breached the inner sanctum, only to find their work had been done for them. Versulf and the Mage-Barons lay dead on the floor, of injuries apparently self-inflicted.\r\n\r\nK'Leth was never found. As for Versulf, K'Leth's promise of eternal rebirth was little more than a promise for many, but not for him. Versulf would never be a king again, but that matters little to him – his soul was transferred to a new body, and when that one aged, he was given a new one as reward for what he did for K’Leth’s Cult. Indeed, as a staunch ally of K’Leth, kingship is little compared to what power he holds now. Knights Revenant and cultists can now be found all over Teleria, and all owe loyalty to Versulf. His reach has never been wider.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6230#static": "Cleopterix began her life in the Krokhan Desert among the ranks of a band of highwaymen, the Ergkarakk, who operated out of a number of camps between the Deadlands and the Krokhan proper. In those treacherous badlands, it was easy for them to conceal various hideouts and caches. From there the Ergkarakk swooped in to prey upon merchant caravans trundling along the timeworn trade routes of central Peltas. In skirmishes with caravan guards, Cleopterix honed the arts of combat, preferring spears and polearms as her weapons. From her fellow Ergkarakk she learned the honor of thieves and the ways of a family of outlaws: fairness to her brothers and sisters in banditry, stony silence to all outsiders, and violent resistance to the forces of law, order, and tyranny. From the desert and badlands, she learned the lessons of nature’s merciless trials. Her mentors called the falcon the model bandit, for the predatory birds they often saw hunt always struck from on high with speed and grace.\r\n\r\nCleopterix accumulated influence and prestige due to her victories, and thought that a place on the council of Ergkarakk leadership would surely await her. But her rapid rise caused jealousy in the more established of her band. Together, they agreed that while changes in leadership were to come, Cleopterix and her followers would never be suitable power-holders. Their reasoning was spurious and Cleopterix’s merits were undeniable, but it was the will of the old guard that she be made an example of, a warning to others tempted to risk upsetting the order of things.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened that she fell for a trap. The Ergkarakk patriarchs heard of a powerful Dwarven merchant-prince who loathed the band and plotted to divide and weaken them. Seeing a chance to rid themselves of Cleopterix and maintain an alibi, the band's leaders struck a deal with the Dwarf behind her back. Cleopterix and her loyal raiders were sent to intercept a caravan that resembled any other. Not long after their attack began, previously concealed elite heavy infantry comprising battle-hardened Humans, Orcs, and Dwarves poured forth from the wagons. After heavy fighting, Cleopterix alone survived, having fled deep into canyons that were unknown to her.\r\n\r\nWounded and without provisions, Cleopterix felt doom creep close as a day and a night passed in those barren chasms. Thirst and hunger weakened her, and falcons and buzzards circled overhead. She cursed her fate and her betrayal again and again, wishing she could strangle the foolish old leaders of the Ergkarakk who did this to her, for by now she realized her folly. Though weak, she summoned the strength to break the long, spindly necks of the handful of vultures that came near her. She did not eat their flesh, for she knew that when raw, it would sicken her. For three days, Cleopterix lay in a stalemate between death and its carrion birds. The scrawny vultures had by now learned that though Cleopterix was dying, she was still too dangerous to go near. Then a falcon swooped down among the vultures, unaware of what they knew, and approached her.\r\n\r\nSlipping into delirium, Cleopterix stared at the bird. She recalled how her treacherous mentors revered the falcon for its virtue in hunting and its noble, handsome lines. Their faces flashed before her eyes. The virtues they had taught her had been the lies of hypocrites. With a last burst of vigor, she seized the falcon just like she did the vultures, and killed it with her hands and teeth, suffering grievous wounds from its claws and beak in the struggle. Facing death and the horror of being eaten by the vultures, she wanted to feast one last time. She drank the falcon’s blood and ate its flesh raw, as a last, savage act of living before death could finally take her.\r\n\r\nStories tell of how when Cleopterix drank the bird’s blood, a wild and furious power rushed into her and thrashed within her being, fighting for dominance, demanding a place. She screamed to the sky and the buzzards dispersed in a massive cloud, squawking in panic at what had been created. For she was now a Skinwalker, a hybrid of raptor and Human, and when she fully regained control of her body and her senses, she found a new chance at life had been granted to her. Whether it will be a life of bloody vengeance or a journey on a new and different path is a question whose answer is unfolding even now.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6240#static": "Teumesia was raised in the rugged forest border marches of Kaerok, where one is prone to encounter brigands, Orcs, or roving Human tribes, rather than the trappings of civilization. An orphan, Teumesia was passed between the care of various distant cousins in the messy and chaotic outpost where she dwelled. Between them they offered only meager attention and guidance and she soon found her peace in the wilds, teaching herself the skills of hunting and trapping. Before long she was contributing valuable furs, horns, and antlers to the community. After she came of age and had proven her worth, Teumesia did not forget that the townsfolk had treated her as a pest and a burden. Lingering resentment gnawed at her, but she held her tongue rather than risk aggravating the only community she had ever known.\r\n\r\nOne day she found one of her traps sprung, but empty. Suspecting her catch robbed, she stopped and scanned the treeline, and spotted a shape receding into the distance. Rather than return empty-handed to her people, she gave chase, and caught up to the potential thief with surprising ease. To her surprise, she found a biped with bestial features, crouched on its haunches like a bashful hound and holding a dead fox in its human-like hands. Teumesia had not heard the term Skinwalker, but she had heard tales of man-beasts – now she was face to face with one.\r\n\r\nThrough sobs, the creature confessed her story: her name was Akalasta. She had been part of a merchant caravan, and one day, when times were tough, she had killed a game animal to supplement their supplies. She’d transformed in front of her friends, who cast her out with a beating, leaving her starving and alone, an animal released into the wild with few survival skills. Knowing well the feeling of rejection, Teumesia felt sympathy for Akalasta and vowed to help her in what way she could. They cultivated a friendship that brightened their lives, but that friendship eventually brought sorrow to them both.\r\n\r\nThe trouble began over a meal. Teumesia had noticed how Akalasta would skulk and hide when feeding, and she guessed that her friend was ashamed to be seen eating raw flesh like an animal. But one day the shy Skinwalker offered to share a kill with Teumesia, which she accepted. She noticed how her friend brought a certain gravity and almost ritual dignity to their first shared meal. Teumesia found it strange, but out of love and trust for her friend, she ate.\r\n\r\nBut this was something more than a friendly feast. A revenant spirit passed from the Skinwalker’s body into the dead flesh, an animal soul blighted by Darkness and made into that virus that afflicts the mind, body, and soul. As Teumesia consumed that flesh, the raging spirit, that of a fox, entered her. In a few torturous minutes her body was covered in ruddy fur, fangs and claws burst from her mouth and fingers, and her senses of smell and hearing became almost overwhelmingly sharp. As Teumesia slowly regained her bearings, she was struck by a fact she perhaps found more upsetting than her mutated body: her companion seemed thrilled. \r\n\r\nTeumesia realized that her duplicitous friend had planned this all along. She listened as Akalasta argued that this transformation had made them both faster, stronger, and powerful in ways neither could ever have achieved in the previous mundane course of their lives. Akalasta had decided she needed a true companion, someone who could share in the grisly joy she expected they’d create together. After all, what had society ever offered or given to them? Far from the weeping scavenger Teumesia had first met, Akalasta was now filled with the thrill of the hunt and a lust for more blood.\r\n\r\nThinking her rhetoric effective, Akalasta allowed Teumesia to approach her. But her words meant nothing to Teumesia – Akalasta's grave abuse of trust had broken her heart. Teumesia sank her fangs into the neck of her former friend and there followed a bloody brawl that only Teumesia walked away from. From that day forward, Teumesia never knew peace nor ease nor comfort of home, and to this day she wanders still, ignorant of much of the truth of her condition and desperate to resolve it.",

Those who survive the searing heat and biting winds must then face the challenge of reaping a living in a climate that takes far more than it gives. Every Nomad in the Krokhan Desert has lost some or all of their families, and with no place to call home, family is all any truly have, and often is whoever is around. Tuhanarak stayed close to her fellow travelers and valued them greatly. With their help, Tuhanarak learned not only to survive, but learned the importance of taking care of others, for they took care of her.\r\n\r\nThe Nomads of Krokhan have more to endure than the indifference of nature – they are also prone to raids. It is one small mercy then, that they have a hero such as Tuhanarak in their midst. Elders in her clan tell how, as a child, Tuhanarak was nearly slain in a brutal raid that left her caravan decimated and her fellow travelers taken hostage. With a sword at her throat, Tuhanarak was forced to her knees by her attackers along with her surviving people. While waiting for her would-be killers to end her life, she prayed to the spirits of her people for help. Her prayers were answered – sand swirled in the air before forming something bright and sharp. It was a glass pendant. Falling into Tuhanarak’s open hand, the pendant burned and shone, seeming to awaken a great force inside her. Though weak from battle, the pendant filled Tuhanarak with new life, giving her the strength to break free from her bindings and fight her stunned attackers, who she finished off with a blinding bolt of lightning that emanated from the jewel itself. Remarkably, those of her people who were captured alongside her that day found their wounds healed and their muscles filled with energy as soon as Tuhanarak freed them from their chains, and all of them lived to tell the tale. \r\n\r\nSince that day, Tuhanarak has kept that pendant close to her chest at all times, and has tried to learn more about the power it possesses. The weapons she forged out of steel in the style of her people have somehow been imbued with the power of the pendant and have been rendered potent indeed. Though the reach of her knives is short, the blinding forks of blue lightning that can come forth from the sharpened blades extend far further. The few survivors of these attacks speak of how they sensed Tuhanarak’s cold, piercing eyes penetrate their mind and felt the pendant drink in their essence.\r\n\r\nIn the dunes of Krokhan, stories abound of how Tuhanarak’s powers have single-handedly defended her desert dwelling allies against hordes of marauding attackers, banishing all to their doom, no matter their size or skill. Her mere presence seems to give power to even the weakest and wounded among her clan, who find that they can achieve feats far beyond their capabilities when Tuhanarak is near. Her deeds have earned her a place in the hearts of all in her clan, and they have bestowed on her the name Heart of the Desert for the protection she brings to them. \r\n\r\nLike many of her clan, Tuhanarak has no interest in great wars or empires. She has no grand plans to dominate Teleria. She lives only to serve her clan and prefers if the world would let them be. But when threatened, she will ensure her clan’s survival without regard for the cost, whether physically and mentally. Though her eyes are always focused on the Krokhan plains, Tuhanarak will occasionally work for hire when necessary, to acquire resources for her people. When the word goes out, many will rush to gain her services. For Tuhanarak's skills and bravery are renowned, and her employers know they will have a much greater chance of survival with her by their side, whatever the challenges they face.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6260#static": "Ba Satha was born from the great Drake breeding pens of the City of Dreams in the Sorrowlakes, and his early life with his pack was one of great enjoyment. Trained as both sturdy pack animals and ferocious war beasts, Ba Satha and his kin were treated well by their Lizardmen handlers, and they shared strong bonds. Ba Satha would do anything to protect his masters and friends, and they would do the same for him. The outbreak of the Gaellen War ripped this idyllic life apart, with him and his fellows thrust into the bloody conflict. Handler and packmate alike were slaughtered with Telerian League steel, and Ba Satha survived through battle after battle by sheer luck.\r\n\r\nDuring one terrible clash, while defending his master, Ba Satha was struck with a mace and knocked unconscious. Hours later, he awoke to find himself alone, in a field of corpses. He rose, cried out for his friends, and roamed through the muck, bodies, and blood, hoping that even one of his broodmates or handlers still lived. He found no-one – only the cruel Knights Revenant and their flesh-pickers, who scoured the battlefields for fresh corpses for use in their rituals. Ba Satha was exhausted and terrified. He was captured easily.\r\n\r\nAfter being chained and dragged to a hidden outpost in the Stormwind Wastes, Ba Satha was subject to horrendous treatment. Injected with vile concoctions, tortured with nightmarish equipment, and forced to eat the flesh of his own kind, his suffering seemed unending. Yet Ba Satha still cried out for his friends, hoping that someone would finally come and lead him back home. Thinking they had finally broken his spirit, Ba Satha’s torturers carried out a deed that would have been barbaric even to other Knights Revenant, had they known about it. They implanted a soul into the Drake's tired form, hoping he would relinquish his body to it. But it was not just any soul – the Knights Revenant had captured a Demonspawn, and they were curious what effect she would have on Ba Satha’s tortured being.\r\n\r\nBa Satha writhed and screamed, as his soul and the Demonspawn's struggled for dominance. As they fought, their body transmogrified, turning Ba Satha into a half-Demonic, half-Drake monstrosity. His wordless howls became guttural sobs, with his calls for help piercing the ears of all who watched this hellish experiment. To the surprise of Ba Satha’s captors, one soul did not dominate the other. Instead, the two merged, uniting behind the same bone-deep desire: escape. Once their synthesis was complete, Ba Satha was no longer an animal – they were a creature wholly unique to the world, with the strength of a Drake and the magic and cunning of a Demonspawn. As their agony finally faded and they adapted to their new form, Ba Satha rose from their haunches and turned on their captors.\r\n\r\nThe Knights Revenant did not flee fast enough.\r\n\r\nEmerging from their prison, Ba Satha was torn as to where to go. They knew of other Demonspawn hiding in the Stormwind Wastes, but they were unsure how they would be received. Instead, they turned north, toward the Sorrowlakes – for the part of Ba Satha that remained a Drake hoped there would be friends there, and safety. Across parched fields, dust bowls, and feeble fords, Ba Satha advanced – limping past ravaged supply trains, ramshackle field hospitals, and mounds of dead. They used their Demonspawn powers to lend themselves strength, burning through magic to keep going. The part that was once a Demonspawn could not help but think what horror might be awaiting them, but the Drake in Ba Satha wanted to be home so badly that there was no turning from the path.\r\n\r\nWhen Ba Satha finally arrived, they did not find their friends. They did not find their enemies. All they found was a smoking ruin, a sea of bodies, and small pockets of Gaellens picking through it all – the remnants of the once great City of Dreams. \r\n\r\nBa Satha dragged himself to what remained of their birthing pen and settled down in the rubble. They let out one last heart-rending scream, hoping some – any – of their broodmates or masters might emerge. But no one came. Even the Gaellens in the ruins were too forlorn, too devastated, at the sight of the destroyed city, to go to him. Exhausted, the bruised and battered Ba Satha let their twisted body collapse. They closed their eyes and hoped for peaceful dreams. They did not get them, but they awoke deciding they would not give up, and so they set out into the wider Sorrowlakes, searching for the family the Drake had lost. How long it would take, or how long the Demonspawn would tolerate this quest, they did not know.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6280#static": "The art of producing and distilling toxins is a part of Lizardman culture reaching back as far as the half-forgotten days of the Dragonkin Empire. Many Lizardmen are capable of producing secretions that can both heal and enhance their kind and poison other species. These can be combined into a near-endless mixture of potions and tinctures that form the basis of the venom magics, a class of sorcery that is part biological, part shamanistic spellcraft.\r\n\r\nThe practitioners of these magics are the Venomages. While not an organized sect, individual Venomages pass on their abilities as part of a long-standing oral tradition, and their network of elders and apprentices runs through the strata of Lizardmen clan life, particularly among the more traditionalist communities in the Sorrowlakes. While not all Lizardmen clans have a Venomage, most know where to find one, seeking their aid in times of disease, famine, war, or when wisdom and knowledge is required.\r\n\r\nHow much the Venomage’s work really is magical, and how much is down to their knowledge and manipulation of Lizardmen physiology is a point of debate, but only those who have not seen the oldest or most powerful Venomages at work – especially during combat – would doubt their abilities. These figures are able to turn the blood of an enemy toxic with a hissed incantation, or set their every nerve ending alight with maddening pain with a flick of their forked tongues.\r\n\r\nSome Venomages claim that they are descended from a venerable Dragonkin priesthood. According to these old fables, they served the Dragonkin Emperor initially as humble food testers, but later they worked as both healers and assassins in service to the empire. While any Lizardman with an affinity for toxins can learn the Venomage’s art, the fact that the majority all hail from a particular serpentine species implies there is some truth to the claims of an ancient hereditary caste.\r\n\r\nThough the Venomages no longer serve an emperor as their sole ruler, among the Lizardmen stories persist of a particularly ancient and powerful member of their kind to which all others owe deference. Known most commonly as Sy’lath, he is said to live deep within the Sorrowlakes, amid near-impenetrable swamplands whose wildlife, flora, and fauna are inimical to most Lizardmen. His knowledge and mastery of Lizardmen biology, as well as his understanding of the uses of the bark, roots, leaves, and sap of many of the marshland’s plant life, have made him a healer beyond compare and given him an unnatural extended lifespan – he may even have served the forces of the Pact during the Gaellen War, centuries ago, so some whisper.\r\n\r\nEven more so than his power to heal, Sy’lath’s power to destroy is formidable. The smallest drop of venom from his own wicked fangs is enough to permanently put down several Ogryn, while his knowledge of toxin-magics allows him to choke, poison, and torture any who raise his ire. Many other, lesser Venomages have sought him out, hoping to trace a path to his simple abode and perhaps prove strong and wise enough to become his apprentice, but if Sy’lath has ever taken on an understudy in the craft of envenoming, it has not been for many years. Perhaps he is now dead, his body reduced to a dry and desiccated husk, or perhaps he still spreads his poisons in secret, waiting until one truly worthy of his knowledge is able to track him down.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6290#static": "From his youngest days, Leorius would bow to no man, beast, or monster. He was possessed of pride and independence so fierce it often proved maladaptive, but he could no more rein in his nature than he could stop a pride of lions from roaming. When he became a Skinwalker, nothing changed.\r\n\r\nThe Skinwalker curse can strike any time a mortal being takes the life of an animal, regardless of circumstance. Certain Skinwalkers can also pass cursed animal souls into a victim. Leorius was struck by one such carrier, a feline Skinwalker so laden with cursed souls as to be utterly feral. The Skinwalker traveled with a pride of lions who looked after him as one of their own, and when Leorius came upon them, they wounded him and he himself transformed into a lion-like, two-legged creature.\r\n\r\nWhen Leorius recovered from the shock of gaining his new form, he resolved to lead a ‘pride’ of his own, without losing himself to savagery. He became a mercenary leader, preferring to recruit Skinwalkers with ferocious battle skill and who were ready to embrace the pack mentality he was cultivating. Leorius the Proud accepted only the most prestigious and highly-paying contracts, never wasting the might of his warband on anything he considered beneath his dignity. Success bred success and recruits flocked to his banner, but he kept his organization small and rejected huge swaths of disappointed would-be warriors. His elite force was kept on call by barons, wizards, and burgermeisters all over east-central Anhelt. Even certain high priests of the Sacred Order were rumored to have called on him despite official injunctions against Skinwalkers.\r\n\r\nBut then, from the west, came the war-fleets of the Gaellen Pact, and armies of Orcs, Ogryn, Lizardmen, and Skinwalkers poured across the land, eager to cause destruction and hungry for plunder. Overnight, Leorius found his band of mercenaries being strong-armed by a dozen different clients, each demanding his service in this time of desperate need, with payment to be deferred until the catastrophe subsided. Their sense of entitlement rankled his legendary pride. Meanwhile, the invading Gaellens reached out to him. In particular, the Skinwalker armies saw him as a misguided potential convert to their cause. Playing on his vanity, they reminded him that he had been serving mere Humans all along, feeding their corrupt war machine, and solving their petty disputes. Instead, the Gaellen Skinwalkers offered him a chance to carve out his own domain under a new regime that would replace the rule of the Telerian League, and thus put an end to what they called centuries of decadence and cruelty.\r\n\r\nBut Leorius saw accepting the Gaellens’ offer as capitulation. Just as the lords of the Telerian League were using the war as a chance to erode his long-guarded independence, the Skinwalkers were trying to turn him into a manageable asset in their burgeoning state apparatus. Leorius was determined his path would always be guided by himself alone, and so he rejected all belligerents of the Gaellen War. He served only his own whims and the demands of his personal honor, and protected his brothers and sisters in battle from both the forces of the Telerian League and the Gaellen Warclave. None would die pointlessly in this war because Leorius himself was pressured into taking one side or another.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Leorius was right to feel as he did. But the fact of his decision was that, in the midst of one of the most apocalyptic wars Teleria had yet witnessed – a fifteen-year conflict spanning nearly the entire globe – he had made enemies of all. It was a situation that, for once, his pride could not overcome. Harried by every faction, each of which believed his gang was a dangerous wildcard and no better than outlaws, his storied cohort was gradually whittled down until Leorius the Proud fought on alone. \r\n\r\nThe end of Leorius’ tale changes with every teller. Some say the Gaellens finally forced him to bend the knee, or slew him for his defiance. Others say Kaerok did likewise, or that the Sacred Order burned him at the stake. Some say he endured the carnage of the Gaellen War and escaped, having somehow shed his old identity. Some even say that Leorius swore he would bow to none but the Arbiter herself, and when she appeared to him in a dream and accepted his offer, he left the borders of the known world to wander in search of her.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6300#static": "The contradictions of the Cult of K’Leth are strong, and rarely more so than in the being known as Mother Cybele. As one of the oldest and most powerful Soul Shepherds, she has played a key role in the soul transferal of thousands of her fellow Knights Revenant, which has earned her renown as a guiding light among even the Cult’s upper echelons. To the lower acolytes and novices, she is nothing less than the matriarch of the sect: wise, benevolent, and powerful.\r\n\r\nAlmost all Knights Revenant set themselves up as heroes to the lesser mortals they lure into the Cult’s service, all the better to acquire fresh bodies for their own usage in the soul transference. Most are merely leeches and corrupters. Aware of their own nature, most Knights Revenant assume the same of Mother Cybele, believing her matriarchal aura is a mere guise for authority. This is likely true, but it may also be possible that Cybele truly believes that she knows what is best for the Cult.\r\n\r\nAuthority is certainly something that has always come easily to Cybele. Once a high priestess of Lumaya, she grew disillusioned with the Goddess of Light while working alongside her self-appointed representatives in the Sacred Order. She witnessed their hypocrisy, and when one force of crusaders sought to ‘cleanse’ – loot – one innocent village too many, Cybele took action. She preached resistance to the villagers, and aided them in rising against the arrogant knights. She herself killed the leader of the Sacred Order warriors with a blow from her staff-mace. From that day forth, she was known as the Red Priestess, a title she embraced by adopting a crimson mask that she now wears at all times.\r\n\r\nCybele continued to preach against the Sacred Order, and while they tried unsuccessfully to have her eliminated, she also came to the attention of darker forces. Members of the Cult of K’Leth approached her, claiming to be defenders of the rights of the common people against the aggressive zealotry and indoctrination of the likes of the Sacred Order. Cybele was too wise to believe such claims immediately, but she saw the potential power the Cult had, and believed, with a hopeful naivety, that she could perhaps turn it toward doing the good it claimed to uphold.\r\n\r\nAnd so Cybele threw herself into the Cult’s activities, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was apprenticed to a Soul Shepherd, and was soon leading soul transference rites herself. The process was no certain thing, fraught with dangers and mishaps. Cybele, however, had a complete success rate with her ceremonies, treating each of the many soul gems in her care with a tenderness befitting that of a loving midwife. She became the most sought-after Soul Shepherd in the Cult. Truly, as she 'birthed' souls into their new flesh, the Red Priestess became their ‘mother.’ As decades passed her reputation became vital to her own identity, as she came to prize her standing within the Cult above her old intentions to turn the Knights Revenant towards righteousness. She had discovered her true calling, that of a shepherd of immortality. \r\n\r\nSuch a position ensures that Cybele has prime access to the strongest and freshest bodies for her own soul, ahead of even some of the highest ranking among Cult. Those jealous of her power whisper that she abuses this, and that her crimson mask is a convenient disguise for how regularly she changes bodies. Some even claim that she is addicted to the transference and that she takes on new flesh on an almost weekly basis. This is of great concern to other Knights Revenant, who might claim that bodies that should belong to them are being misappropriated, but such is Cybele’s standing that none have publicly challenged her - yet.\r\n\r\nSome argue that such claims are unfounded. Certainly, Mother Cybele has made great sacrifices for the Cult, sinking time and energy into ensuring the safe transference of other Knights Revenant, as well as taking to the battlefield when the Cult’s assets come under serious threat. None can question her dedication, nor the strength and vigor of her addresses when she preaches to the Cult’s acolytes, putting her old high priestess oratory skills to good use. Any intentions she might once have harbored, of using her membership of the Cult as a force for good, seem to have long been subsumed by her continued efforts to remain a master of soul transference and see the souls of those in her care into their new bodies.\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that only the unwise and the short-sighted within the Cult speak openly against Mother Cybele. For even if she is not the matriarchal figure she shows herself as, she is the only certain means for many Knights Revenant to continue their jealously guarded immortality.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6310#static": "Teleria stood empty, and from the Waters of Life the gods created their Firstborn, Vasal among them. Immortal, ageless, with advanced and inscrutable intellects, these Firstborn took many forms and had innumerable dispositions. Each and every one was powerful beyond reckoning, and when the peace between them was shattered, the conflict that ensued was one of mind-boggling scope and incalculable misery. \r\n\r\nThe war of immortals known as the Great Divorce was the result of the irreconcilable difference between the two creator deities, Lumaya the Light and Siroth the Darkness. Lumaya was slow and cautious during the Dances of Creation, obsessed with details and meticulous in observing her creations. Siroth was wild and unrestrained, forever seeking the ecstasy of new creations and experiments. Siroth would have Danced until the roil of creation undid everything the gods had made already, tearing Teleria apart and dooming all their previous creations to perpetual chaos. Lumaya felt obliged to protect what they had already created, and came to refuse to Dance with Siroth.\r\n\r\nSiroth would not be denied, and pursued Lumaya to take her by force. The Firstborn felt the echoes of divine fear and desire, and division spread between them. Thus the Great Divorce brought war to the Firstborn, and it was a horror unlike any other. The Firstborn could not die, but could feel pain. They could not tire, but could still feel disgust and anguish. Their battles lasted for months or years, limited only by the reserves of their mighty wills. Vasal fought and fought, and became strong. Even raging dragons felt fear for the first time upon hearing Vasal’s name.\r\n\r\nBut the reason for Vasal’s great success was his insight and his ruthlessness. He knew that there could be no victory in a conflict of immortals without a way to deprive the enemy of a resource, and that the currency to do this with was pain. With pain comes fear, and the destruction of the will, and that was what it took to turn the tide of a battle and to ultimately win the war. So Vasal, in Lumaya’s name, committed himself and his warriors to relentless torture and enforced submission, attempting to isolate specific foes and then abduct and excoriate their captive with holy scourges and lances of light. Even Siroth’s most devoted servants, when presented with absolute despair and eternal torment, could be made to give up.\r\n\r\nVasal could not inflict such egregious violence without tainting his immortal soul. Perhaps he knew this, or perhaps not. Regardless, every atrocity he visited upon his sanctioned foes made him feel ever-greater pride and perverse glee. The Goddess and the Arbiter watched the progress of Vasal’s armies and the success of his terror tactics with mixed emotions. It could win them the war, but blacken the hearts of all who prosecuted it. Siroth saw Vasal’s corruption and smirked, for he knew all along that a reign of pain and torment was the inevitable outcome of the war of the immortals – and any who came to revel in this state of misery would become susceptible to his influence. When he saw Vasal was ripe for his taking, Siroth projected his will across Teleria and searched for the troubled champion of Light, and found him as he rested. Vasal’s twisted and vengeful dreams were like a beacon to the lord of Darkness.\r\n\r\nThat night, Siroth placed a great seal upon Vasal’s chest, a mark of what lay within displayed without. When Vasal awoke from his troubled sleep he saw it, and Siroth’s will flooded his mind. In an instant Vasal relived every cruelty he had inflicted, while Siroth’s silken whispers promised him more of the same: more power, more violence, more suffering for all who opposed him. Vasal emerged from his chambers and tore through his own comrades, rampaging and cackling, the Seal pulsating with his heartbeat that hammered faster and faster the more he ripped and excruciated and mutilated.\r\n\r\nWhile the fall of Vasal – but a single Firstborn – could not turn the tide of the war in itself, it did herald the turning of the tide against Lumaya, and soon the Goddess had no choice but to end the conflict with a great banishment spell. She and all her servants were sent to the Halls of Eternity, and Siroth and his minions, Vasal included, were sent to Siroth’s fractured domain of Anathraad, stripped of the last lingering Light in their souls. Vasal awoke in Anathraad twisted in mind and body, a Demon, along with the other Firstborn who had let Darkness come to rule their hearts.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6320#static": "A single moment, a hesitation, a choice. These things can alter the known course of events, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. The path not taken is often a source of regret… or of relief, for even the most incurious of beings cannot help but ask… what if? What if Kael had not met Elhain, and found something different in the caverns of Aravia after Queen Eva’s first Conclave?\r\n\r\nWhen Kael descended into the caverns beneath the capital city of Aravia, he wondered if he had made the correct choice in doing so. The caverns felt wrong, as if the very rockface seeped dark magic. But he mustered his resolve and continued his exploration as, above him, the renewed peace talks between the High Elves and Dark Elves continued. \r\n\r\nThe network of tunnels and caves were ancient, as old as Teleria itself. Kael suspected that the magic he felt heralded some forgotten trove of mystical lore, and he was determined to find it. But the deeper he went, the stronger the pull of dark magic grew. \r\n\r\nMore than once, Kael thought he heard his own voice echoing out of the gloom. At times, he thought he even glimpsed himself… his reflection, perhaps, cast in the dull crystalline growths that encrusted the deep caverns. Or maybe it was his mind playing tricks on him. Regardless, his other selves seemed to be leading him in one particular direction, toward the strongest concentration of dark magic. \r\n\r\nSoon, he found himself standing in a vaulted cavern, and staring at an unexpected sight: a staff of sinister design, floating within a murky crystal. It resembled his own after a fashion, but was far more ornate, and it fairly thrummed with power. He realized that he’d read of such an item before, in one of the ancient texts he’d studied so assiduously. It was called the Black Rod, and was an artifact created from pure shadow magic.\r\n\r\nSomething about it called to him. A whisper in his mind promised him knowledge and power in equal measure. It told him that if he was brave enough to claim it, all his dreams would come true. \r\n\r\nYet Kael hesitated on the cusp of claiming the Rod. For an instant, he thought he saw his future stretching out before him. What if he took it, and the power he sensed within it overcame him? \r\n\r\nHe saw himself, garbed in fine robes and wielding the staff; his power increased beyond his wildest imaginings. He returned to his people and used his newfound might to break the grip of the noble families, free the serfs, and assume control of the Dark Elves. He made peace with the High Elves. But there was a cost to it all. \r\n\r\nThe whispers of the Black Rod never ceased. Indeed, they only grew in strength as time passed. The fell magic contained within the artifact demanded a release, and it sought to twist its bearer’s motives into something base and self-serving, the better to secure that release. The more he wielded the Rod, the more of a hold it would have on him. \r\n\r\nSoon, it would be impossible to tell where the mind of the Black Rod ended and that of its wielder began. Kael would no longer be the mage he had been. Instead, he would be a locus of dark sorcery, twisting the world around him to suit his darkest desires. \r\n\r\nOr perhaps his spirit would prove equal to the test. Perhaps he would break the Rod to his will, and become the mage his people deserved. \r\n\r\nOnly time would tell.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6340#static": "Magnarr was born in the Age of Hellfire, in the foothills of the Dawnmounts. The son of a blacksmith from a small old Dragonkin colony called Akalu, he was taught honesty and dedication by his hard-working parents, and grew up strong of arm, accustomed to the heat of the forge. Until Magnarr reached early manhood, life was hard, but peaceful. He loved his town and people, and so never spoke of his boredom.\r\n\r\nBut then the sorcerer, Davalo, came.\r\n\r\nHe believed there was life in a dormant volcano close to Akalu, and intended to use its raw heat to further his pyromantic research. A ruthlessly driven man, he thought nothing of the danger that reawakening the volcano would pose.\r\n\r\nDavalo stirred up the mountain’s heart, and when the leaders of Akalu went to him and demanded he cease, he refused, burning them to ash.\r\n\r\nIn response, a militia was mobilized in Akalu, Magnarr among them. He took up his great blacksmith's smelting hammer and pieces of offcast armor from his workshop. Strong, plain-speaking, and eager, he inspired his fellows, who dubbed him the Forge Warrior. He never spoke of his excitement at the unfolding events.\r\n\r\nDespite the arming of the townsfolk, Davalo still refused to halt his experiments, and when the soldiers tried to seize him, he used the volcano's rumbling power to conjure fire spirits and magma golems to attack them. Most were killed, burning holes punched through them with flaming fists, or their flesh melted from their bones with blasts of primordial heat.\r\n\r\nA few, however, survived, Magnarr among them, his armor and hammer well used to searing temperatures. Even then, he was horribly burned, kept standing only by adrenaline and hatred for the sorcerer who had killed so many of his people. He forced his way to Davalo by sheer strength of will. The sorcerer laughed, and told Magnarr he was too good, too strong, for this place. His talents could be put to greater causes, if he so wished. The Forge Warrior was tempted, but anger and loyalty saw him bring his enormous hammer down on Davalo's head. In that instant, the fire-riven wizard became a cloud of ash, rather than a pulverized mush of flesh and bone.\r\n\r\nMagnarr barely had time to acknowledge the bizarre death of the sorcerer when a voice entered his head. It said that he had done well, but he was too late. The sorcerer's work was finished, and the volcano would erupt. Unless, that was, Magnarr pledged his hammer, mind, and muscles to the voice. His ego stroked, the thrill of perhaps some new life being opened to him, as well as desire to save his town, all swayed Magnarr. He did not know the voice was Siroth, and if he did would not have known what that truly meant. He accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Shadow God channeled the fury of the mountain into Magnarr, expending the energy as it fused with the man in the same instant that Siroth’s magics warped him. Gone was the bold and honest young blacksmith – now he stood transmuted, a creature of perpetual magma and fiery resolve. The instant this was complete, he made for a portal to Anathraad, and went to Siroth, who made him a Demonspawn.\r\n\r\nSince that day, the former Forge Warrior has worked dutifully as Siroth’s chief smelter and blacksmith, his former personality melted down by centuries of service in the workshops of Anathraad. And while the hammer that he still carries he employs most often in beating white-hot metals into tools of war, he can use it just as easily to pulp the flesh and shatter the bones of Siroth’s enemies.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6430#static": "What do you fight for? This is the question that defined Kyoku’s life. Born late into the Shadowkin rebellion against the Mikage Autocracy, the fight to liberate Yakai from the Mikage’s rule was all she knew. Training of both body and mind began at a young age for her. Teachings of Yakai’s history, its ideology, and its golden period of prosperity and freedom were just as important as any lesson with spear and shield. Their mission was to ‘restore honor to the kingdom’, a phrase that Kyoku recited daily, never sure if she truly believed in it or if she was just doing what she was told and what all her peers did.\r\n\r\nAs the rebellion finally gained momentum, Kyoku led raids, captured strategic locations, and disrupted vital enemy supply lines at the forefront of several of the rebellion’s successes. Their victory became inevitable. Realizing this, many Mikage warlords and administrators burned villages they held to the ground, slaughtered peasants indiscriminately, and salted the soil before fleeing from oncoming rebel forces. Faced with a fractured and vengeful enemy committing acts of terror across the nation as they were consolidating their newly won gains, the rebellion’s leaders knew they could not protect everyone – trying would dangerously overstretch their forces. \r\n\r\nAs reward for her service, Kyoku was placed in charge of a vital strongpoint, tasked with establishing stores, barricades, and watchtowers and maintaining a garrison to cement the rebellion’s hold. What do you fight for? The question ringed in Kyoku’s mind, as her new position forced her to turn a blind eye to the suffering of nearby towns and villages experiencing the wrath of dislodged Demonspawn and their mortal followers. Was this restoring honor? she wondered. When news arrived that Kahino, her home village, had been terrorized by a band of Demonspawn, she decided to look away no longer.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival at Kahino, Kyoku was greeted with flames and destruction. The sight of burnt out houses, and the once-pristine river overflowing with corpses, hurt Kyoku in a way that no weapon ever had. She found the remaining people hiding in the village’s outskirts, a fierce debate raging between them over whether they should stay or flee. Not wanting to see more people displaced from their homes, Kyoku promised to stay and help fight off the Demonspawn should more come, and so they stayed. \r\n\r\nAs night fell, Kyoku sat alone, sharpening her spear, contemplating whether she had made the right decision abandoning her post. She had little time to ponder however, for Demonspawn did indeed come. Ordering those who could fight to occupy the smaller minions, Kyoku faced down a hulking behemoth with flames curling at the edge of its mouth and wielding a trident dripping with blood. When it charged, the ground shook. Kyoku lifted her shield and rattled under the impact of its first, terrible blow, which threatened to shatter her bones. In return she thrust her spear toward the Demonspawn’s throat. The monster unfurled scaly wings and bat away the strike, and Kyoku withdrew and regrouped. The Demonspawn bore down on her again, raining down a flurry of blows. Kyoku held steadfast behind her shield, though each of her foe’s attacks was vicious and agonizing. As it grew increasingly frustrated by its resolute opponent, the fiend noticed a child cowering under a table. Knocking the table aside, the Demonspawn thrust down its trident to impale the defenseless youth. Kyoku slid her spear between the weapon’s prongs just in time to stop the plunging weapon, then wrenched with all her might to wrest the trident from the Demonspawn’s grasp. With the brute unarmed, Kyoku thrust her spear one final time, burying it so deep in the creature’s neck it burst out the other side. Kyoku attempted to withdraw her weapon but it was firmly stuck, and the Demonspawn used the last of its strength to rake a claw across her face and neck, carving open deep wounds and gouging out an eye. Finally spent, it crashed to the ground in death, blood still gushing from the wound in its neck. Victorious, but exhausted and bleeding, Kyoku collapsed. \r\n\r\nHaving been nursed back to health by the villagers she had nearly died defending, Kyoku awoke to find her wounds tightly bound. She was scarred, but alive. Weeks passed as Kyoku slowly recuperated in Kahino’s idyllic hills, and a new sense of purpose dawned on her. She did not want to ‘restore’ honor to the kingdom, she did not want Yakai to ‘return’ former glories, for she had never experienced them. She instead wanted to build something new, something better, in which people were prized over state. Though that would put her at odds with many of Yakai’s new leaders, she knew now it was what she was fighting for all along.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6440#static": "At the height of the Gaellen War, it was unclear which side would emerge victorious. The Telerian League’s defenses stood resolute, but the Gaellen Pact’s onslaught was unrelenting. Though the Gaellen Pact eventually lost this terrible and bloody conflict, there were notable victories for one of its battalions, led by the Orc Danag Skullreap. Over the course of a few weeks, they rampaged across northern Kaerok, defeating the armies of Reynald the Convert, knight of the Banner Lords, and Saint Meredith, a hero of the Sacred Order. They finally met their match in a High Elf host, after putting the large town of Longbarrow, which lay close to Durham Forest, to the torch. Thousands died in the bloodbath, in which the Aravian forces were ultimately victorious. Danag and what remained of his army fled, and hundreds of his warriors were slaughtered by pursuing Elves. The Orc warlord found himself alone, apparently the only survivor of his battalion, as he fled into Durham Forest.\r\n\r\nManaging to escape his pursuers as he pressed relentlessly through the trees, Danag knew he was still not safe, for in the cloying darkness of the wood there were a great many dangers – monsters, carnivorous plants, and the Dark Elves. Against his better judgment, Danag sat at the base of a tree, too exhausted and badly wounded to continue without rest. He fought the urge to sleep, but ultimately succumbed. With slumber came a cruel new fate. Happening upon the bloody Orc on a patrol, Dark Elf forces bound and captured him whilst he slept, taking him deep within the forest, from which he would not emerge for many years. During Danag's imprisonment, the Dark Elves experimented upon him. They injected vibrantly colored liquids into him, grafted razor-sharp metals onto his skin, and wreaked dark magics upon his mind as they attempted to mold him into a weapon that could be controlled and unleashed upon their High Elf nemeses. Through the pain and torment, Danag’s will remained steadfast, and the Dark Elves were unable to bend him to their malevolent intent. As the years passed, Danag’s bitterness grew, alongside his fury at losing his army, and at being captured. A singular thought slowly coalesced in his mind: hatred of all Elves. \r\n\r\nAfter many years, Danag was presented with an opportunity to escape his tormentors. One winter had been particularly bitter and cruel, and a wave of sickness swept through Danag’s captors. Where once there were at least eight guards patrolling the cells where he was kept captive with a host of other prisoners from across Teleria, that number began to fall, until one morning only a sole guard remained. Sensing his opportunity, Danag pulled and smashed at his bindings to get the sentry's attention. Hearing thuds of flesh on metal and the Orc’s feral shouts, the guard went to the cell to investigate. Seeing what Danag was attempting, he ordered the Orc to stop. When Danag ignored him, he drew his sword, unlocked the cell door, and stepped inside to force the Orc to comply. In an instant, Danag bore down upon the guard, using one hand to wrench the sword from his hand, while he pinned him to the wall by his throat with the other. The Orc drove the blade deep into the guard’s gut, and then let his corpse collapse to the ground. Danag took his keys, freed himself, and then freed the rest of the prisoners who, like him, had been subjected to experimentation by the Dark Elves. After retrieving their weapons from their captors’ armory, they stormed out of the prison and into the depths of the forest, slaying all those who tried to stop them. \r\n\r\nMost of the prisoners raced for the edge of the forest as fast as their legs could carry them. Danag, however, had a different idea, for he was intent on making his oppressors pay for what they had done to him. From this day on, he decided he would remain in the forest and be a scourge to High and Dark Elves alike. Over the next months he killed hundreds of them, raiding their settlements and picking off patrols. In response, both factions began a concerted effort to hunt Danag down. Watchtowers were erected, patrols were doubled, and every inch of the forest was scoured for the seemingly unstoppable Orc. Eventually, the Elven search was so thorough that Danag had no choice but to leave, lest he risk being cornered and captured once again. He made his way east, seeking to reunite with his people in the Sorrowlakes and continue his quest for vengeance wherever he might find other Elves.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6450#static": "The origins of the Most Holy Church of Lumaya are humble, and largely lost to time and memory. From a single Lumayan temple in Narbuk, the Church spread across Teleria, gaining followers and influence over the centuries during the Age of Hellfire and the Demonspawn invasion that precipitated the Second Great War. During this time, the Church was a symbol of hope, and its Warpriests were to be found on every battlefield. But they were not alone in their devotion to Lumaya.\r\n\r\nThere was also the Sacred Order. \r\n\r\nIn the earlier days of the Church, before its power was as assured as it is now, its relationship with the Sacred Order was a fraught one. The nascent Church feared the that the powerful Order might consume them in its fervor and haste to spread the faith. \r\n\r\nEven as the Second Great War came to an end, the Church was already mobilizing to face this perceived threat to its sovereignty. They were determined to bring the Order to heel by any means necessary, and put it in what the Church saw the its place in Lumaya’s grand scheme to be – as facilitator and defender of the faith, rather than its master. \r\n\r\nBut the then-Abbess of the Sacred Order, no stranger to Church politics, was all too aware of the Church’s feelings and moved quickly to counter – or at least delay – any attempt to curb the Order’s dominance. The Abbess commanded agents of the Order spread throughout Kaerok and the Free Cities, working to undermine trust in the Church, and weaken its influence over local political affairs. Nowhere was this more evident than in Narbuk – the very heart of the Church’s power. While the conflict was restricted mostly to propaganda and fierce debate, brawls occasionally broke out between militant monks and the warriors of the Sacred Order in the months that followed. \r\n\r\nEventually, the conflict threatened to spill over into secular affairs, as both the Order and the Church attempted to garner support from the King of Kaerok, as well as the rulers of Free Cities such as Delanos and Arnoc. Indeed, the situation had become so volatile that some among the Order feared that the Arbiter herself might take notice. A solution was called for – a unifying figure was needed, to end the fighting and unite the Sacred Order and the Church once and for all. \r\n\r\nOne was found. His name was Pinthroy. \r\n\r\nA Church Warpriest of some distinction, Pinthroy was famous for both his dogged devotion to Lumayan doctrine as well as his ferocity in battle. He had carried the Light of Lumaya into the darkest of tombs and the murkiest of fens, rousing his followers with fiery sermons and militant rhetoric that focused less on Lumaya’s love and more on her wrath. In his impassioned speeches, he railed not only against Demonspawn and Undead, but also the 'repulsive' Orcs and Lizardmen, and the 'abominable' first Skinwalkers.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of his activities, Pinthroy had often worked closely with the warriors of the Sacred Order, and was well-respected by them. He was also much loved by the lay clergy of the Church, who believed him to be the ideal to which all priests of the faith ought to aspire, even in spite of his extreme prejudice toward non-Humans. \r\n\r\nIn short, Pinthroy was the perfect candidate to be the Archbishop of the Church of Lumaya. Respected by both sides, with an awareness of what the Order was and how it best functioned. A man like him could ensure peace between the two factions and an end to the conflict. \r\n\r\nOf course Pinthroy, being the man he was, did not see the offer of elevation to high office as a reward. He preferred to be in the field, away from the political struggles that dominated the upper reaches of the Church hierarchy as well as that of the Sacred Order. Indeed, the very fact that his appointment was a result of sectarian infighting only made him more reluctant.\r\n\r\nDespite his protests, Pinthroy was soon installed in his new offices, and though it took him some time to become used to his new position, he eventually came to see the wisdom behind his elevation. He realized that he had had been invested with the power to spread and push his ideals much further than he ever could have done as a Warpriest. The years that followed proved the Abbess correct in her estimation of Pinthroy, for under his stern guidance, the Church of Lumaya grew closer than ever to the Sacred Order. No longer working against each other, the two swiftly expanded their reach and influence across Anhelt. But under Pinthroy's guidance, the seeds of the brutality that would come to define the Order in future centuries were thus planted.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6460#static": "Dragons are Firstborn – some of the oldest beings in creation, and all now are Demonspawn servants of Siroth. They are immortal and so powerful that they are all but indestructible. While their mortal form can be vanquished, their soul will be sent back to Anathraad upon death, from where they can one day return to Teleria through any one of many portals, as ferocious as ever before.\r\n\r\nOne Dragon, Hellrazor, wreaked havoc in the Confederation of Frostheim after the Second Great War. The six kings of Frostheim gave up hope of slaying the beast, but their Dwarven-trained smith – Askara Dwarfkin – made a proposal. With an unbreakable chain forged with Dwarven runescript and Aravian arcanistry, they could trap not only the dragon, but even its soul, and thus keep it from returning to Anathraad. The six kings agreed, but there was a flaw to this plan – how to convince the monster to land, and how to keep it there long enough for Askara to attach the chain.\r\n\r\nAnd so, they turned to Roric. One of the few yarls of the kingdom who survived the Second Great War, he was the finest commander in Frostheim. He was one of their strongest warriors, and wielded an enchanted hammer so powerful it could crush Hellrazor's skull. His duty would likely lead to his death – Hellrazor had already killed hundreds in a matter of days. Roric had no delusions regarding the danger, but he knew his duty, and he knew the stakes. He agreed to the kings' request, and formulated a plan.\r\n\r\nAt Roric's request, the six kings ordered select contents of their treasury to be laid out in a cave on a mountainside, to lure the greedy Hellrazor within its depths. Askara bolted one end of her chain to the cave wall, and she and Roric went into hiding. When the dragon landed, Askara remained out of sight, a length of chain bundled her arms. Roric however emerged and blocked the exit to the cave behind the dragon, hammer in hand. The battle between the yarl and the dragon was fierce and terrible – Roric broke bone, shattered scales, and cracked teeth, all while dodging every blow – but even Roric’s skill was not so great he could avoid Hellrazor's strikes indefinitely. He was finally caught in a burst of the dragon’s flaming breath and the creature smashed its tail into him. He screamed in pain, losing his hammer and falling to the ground next to one of the monster’s broken teeth. He had distracted the dragon enough however for Askara to weave between the combatants and magically bind her chain to the dragon, trapping it in the cave.\r\n\r\nWhen Hellrazor realized it was held, it spun around, tugged furiously at the chain, and unleashed gouts of flame upon it, but to no avail. Enraged, it threw itself against its bonds again and again, and roared its fury to the mountainside. As it thrashed and flailed, it left itself open. Summoning the last of his strength, the burned, dying Roric climbed upon the beast's back, scaled its long neck, and hammered the broken tooth he had found directly into the monster's skull. At this, Hellrazor screeched, flailed, and finally collapsed, lifeless. Unlike all other Demonspawn to have been slain before it, its soul remained trapped in its body. While it would inevitably return to physical life, it would be trapped here, unless the chain or its magic were ever broken.\r\n\r\nRoric Wyrmbane fell to the ground from the beast's neck with a crunch of mail and breaking bones. Askara rushed to aid him, but his burns and other injuries were too terrible even for a skilled mage to treat. It would take a miracle to save him, and that is what he received.\r\n\r\nA glowing, golden light descended from the cave mouth, and a beautiful, elegant figure with shining armor and flame-red hair weaved between stalagmites and stalactites. She came to the dying Roric and offered him a Shard, in which he might preserve his life to defend Teleria for the rest of time. Roric was exhausted. He was in agony, so much so he could barely think. He was afraid, but through the haze of his life’s last moments, he felt pride. He had saved his people, and could not bear to leave them forever. He agreed. Then he was gone, his body vanished and his soul absorbed into the woman's golden crystal. Askara returned to the six kings, to tell them of Roric’s victory. They declared him the Wyrmbane.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6470#static": "In the distant past, a kingdom of the Lost Isles rose to particular prominence under the rulership of a noble Human family by the name of Marone. The sire of the Marones had made a pact with Siroth, becoming a Demonspawn, and passed his link with the Shadow God down through the generations. The Marones were all-powerful within the island realm, and their rule was considered by most of their subjects to be harsh but fair.\r\n\r\nWhen King Marone bore a daughter, the island rejoiced, for in doing so he had secured the line of succession. He named the Demon-touched infant Wythir, and swore she would one day inherit the crown. This did not sit well with the king’s brother, Trenchard, who had long coveted the throne for himself.\r\n\r\nAs was tradition, the king and queen eventually passed into Anathraad, leaving Wythir, who had just come of age, to rule. It was at this point that Trenchard made his move. He usurped Wythir on the day of her coronation and had her confined to the dungeons. Now, instead of a crown, she wore chains.\r\n\r\nTrenchard sought to assert his dominance over the island, but found he could not do so while Wythir lived. Many remained loyal to her, and so, Trenchard decided that simply imprisoning the princess was not enough. Taking up a dagger, he descended into the dungeons to finish the job.\r\n\r\nWhat he did not know was that, while she was confined, Wythir had reached out to Siroth. She claimed that Trenchard was not truly loyal to Anathraad, and pleaded for the chance to stop his usurpation. In exchange, she swore eternal allegiance to the Shadow God. Unwittingly, when Trenchard plunged his dagger into Wythir’s breast, he was conducting the sacrifice in a ceremony that would see him destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs the seemingly fatal blow was struck, dark power coursed through Wythir. She broke the first of her bonds, then Trenchard’s neck. On that day, Siroth’s Demonspawn swept through the island, killing any loyal to Trenchard, and Wythir’s dark coronation was complete. Her head was crowned by a multitude of magnificent, wicked horns and the glowing blue spirit-light of Trenchard, which she was allowed to keep imprisoned for eternity. The knife that Trenchard sought to slay her with remained impaled within her chest, perhaps as a reminder of how close she came to oblivion, or as an eternal token of her renewed pact with the Shadow God.\r\n\r\nWythir the Crowned ruled her island home for a long time, but eventually passed through to Anathraad, where she asserted herself as one of Siroth’s most favored followers. Maintaining a guise of perpetual youth, she cast herself in the role of Princess of Anathraad, and has even at times claimed to be Siroth’s future heir and inheritor. The Shadow God seems amused by this play, for he dotes on Wythir like a daughter and indulges her far more than almost any other Demonspawn, bar perhaps Cruetraxa, with whom she has a deep, bitter, though often well-concealed rivalry. Countless high-stationed Demonspawn look upon Wythir with envy, and whisper of how to topple her.\r\n\r\nWhile Wythir, like all Demonspawn, intends to have a part in ruling all of Teleria when Siroth’s dark plans are fully realized, it is said she particularly covets the Lost Isles. Her old kingdom fell long ago, but there are still some among the islanders who have distant memories of their Demonic overlords and claim that one day they will return. Wythir fully intends that to be the case.\r\n\r\nWhen she does enter Teleria, Wythir’s presence is a great inspiration for the many Demonspawn who buy into the favor she holds with Siroth. They fight hard for the crowned princess, believing that she will bestow boons and blessings on those who catch her eye. For her own part, Wythir rarely has to raise a finger, but when she does, her power is displayed in full, for only a fool would think a chosen child of Anathraad would be lacking in strength. In particular, she has the ability to inflict the pain of the dagger in her chest upon those who displease her with a mere gesture, cutting into their very souls. Perhaps one day she will remove the physical blade, but it is unlikely to be before she sits once more upon her island throne.",

Knowledge of this place has been all but lost to the Dwarves. But there are some who are determined to return the Dwarven people to their ancient glory, such as the lorekeeper, Demytha. \r\n\r\nIndeed, it is Demytha's insistence on digging up the past that has earned her the ire of both her king and her fellow lorekeepers. While the Dwarves are not a forward-thinking people by any stretch of the imagination, neither do they wallow in the past. The lorekeepers maintain the historical record, so that other Dwarves might live unencumbered by what has gone before, or knowledge of how far they have fallen since Siroth's Demonspawn invasion destroyed the under-empire. Better that they remember only what the lorekeepers tell them to remember and forget that which is better forgotten. \r\n\r\nBut for Demytha, the deep past is a country she is determined to explore; but not out of simple curiosity. Rather, she seeks to learn more about the Dwarven Emperors of old and the ancient blood-rights that still bind her people, in order to heal the rift she believes is developing between them. For it is no secret, at least among the Dwarves, that relations between the Skyiron Dominion and Gloomdeep Hold have grown strained in recent decades, even if they remain strong. Demytha hopes to find something to unify her people once and for all. \r\n\r\nThis means descending into those unhallowed depths and searching for the lost record-rooms of the under-empire. Then, as now, the Dwarves were meticulous record-keepers, tracing bloodline, ownership, and the like for generation upon generation back into antiquity. Demytha hopes to find these lost records in order to identify the true heir to the Dwarven Emperors of old. To that end, she has financed a number of expeditions into the depths, using her own family's wealth and connections to put together groups of treasure-hunters, cartographers, explorers, and historians to map the remnants of the under-empire and locate the missing record-rooms. \r\n\r\nThese attempts have almost all ended in disaster. For every scrap of knowledge or imperial artifact recovered from the depths, dozens of lives have been lost and chthonic horrors have been stirred to wakefulness by the intruders. More than once, some abomination has been accidentally freed from a lightless cavern and pursued Demytha's people back to the outskirts of Gloomdeep Hold, where Dwarven Tunnel Stewards have been forced to meet the threat. \r\n\r\nThese incidents have damaged Demytha's reputation both among her fellow lorekeepers and with the King at the Heart of the Gloom. After the last such occurrence, during which a titanic cave-scorpion was drawn into the outer districts of the hold, she was ordered to cease funding her expeditions into the darkness or face exile. \r\n\r\nWhile Demytha has ostensibly agreed to leave the past buried, in reality she is more determined than ever to find the knowledge that she seeks. Because of this, she keeps her investigations secret, despite the risk. To that end, she has gathered to her only the most trustworthy explorers and now leads the expeditions herself, hoping with each departure from the safety of Gloomdeep Hold that this time she will be successful.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6540#static": "Sigmund, Baron Highshield, is one of the great heroes of the Age of Hellfire. In those dark days, every corner of Teleria was subjected to intermittent invasion by hordes of Demonspawn and Undead. Infernal sieges drained the resources of even the wealthiest cities and waves of Demonic raiders ravaged the countryside. Despite these harrowing times, Sigmund was a gentle soul. His tutors scolded him for his gregarious nature, since it often distracted him from his drills – he was apt to converse with the common soldiers training alongside him, peppering them with questions with typical childish curiosity. Many thought that fraternizing with those beneath his social standing was harming the dignity of his office. But Sigmund realized that in such blighted times as the Age of Hellfire, camaraderie was all the more meaningful, a fact lost on his conservative peers and minders.\r\n\r\nBoth of Sigmund’s parents were killed when their coach was swept away by a landslide. Still but a lad, shaken but determined, the newly-instated Baron Sigmund ordered a thorough investigation. Secret documents recovered from a Demonspawn encampment his warriors overran revealed that their agents had sabotaged the route with a constructed dead-fall. Worse, according to these coded messages, the assassination was merely the prelude to a full-scale invasion of his Barony. Thus forewarned, he raced to prepare defenses and hoard resources for the bitter years to come.\r\n\r\nThe Highshield Barony, with its majestic castle and expansive fields, was known as a place of plenty and mirth. Its peasants were renowned as growers of fine crops and makers of fine ale, which commanded high prices all over the world. To the Demonspawn, such a jovial and productive territory was ripe for desecration, and so they began one of the most intense invasions of the Age. The jocular, youthful Baron Sigmund transformed rapidly into a stoic, competent, and pragmatic commander. Bearing the shining greatshield that was his ancestral birthright, he defended his frontline troops with great gallantry. Famed for his lustrous white mustache, he commanded the respect of his soldiers because he was willing to share in their sacrifices, never shirking from his duties, and constantly offering up his personal wealth to assuage their suffering. \r\n\r\nAfter devastating the countryside, the armies of Darkness gathered in force to overwhelm Castle Highshield. Messenger birds had informed Sigmund that a relief force from the Sacred Order was rushing to his aid, but it looked as though they would be too late. Desperate for ideas, Sigmund spent a long and frustrating night commiserating with his commanders, poring over infernal lore and battlefield reports for any possible weaknesses in the enemy. Eventually, Sigmund concocted a plan to exploit the willfulness and rapacity of the Demonspawn, inspired by his own generous nature. He emptied his treasure vault of its remaining wealth, and had agents infiltrate the countryside to hide caches of wondrous artifacts and sacks of coin. His spies then seeded rumors of these treasure-troves, which spread like wildfire from the lips of the smallfolk and the invaders alike. Shortly, many of the enemy warlords had broken camp and led their followers to pursue these treasures. The rest had no choice but to follow suit, for they no longer had the force to maintain the siege, and nurtured bitter jealousy to boot. With each find their gold-lust increased, until the Demonspawn were fighting each other over the booty.\r\n\r\nThis loss of focus and increased infighting in his enemies bought Sigmund the time he needed. And so it was that when the Sacred Order army arrived, the Demonspawn were scattered and distracted, and several legions were defeated in detail before the army as a whole regrouped. Faced with the combined might of the ferocious zealots of the Order and Sigmund’s now-reinvigorated troops, the Demonspawn swiftly retreated, taking with them almost the entirety of the Barony’s wealth. Sigmund had saved Highshield, but was left penniless.\r\n\r\nA grand feast was called for to celebrate the victory, but Sigmund had to shamefacedly admit that he had not the resources to properly honor the brave warriors, priests, and magi who had fought and bled for him. Hearing this, the peasantry rallied to their lord, remembering his sacrifices and his warm, humble style of rulership. Whole families flocked to his castle bearing gifts of food and drink, offerings from their smallholdings to be shared in the spirit of family. Some were fortunate enough to have recovered some of the treasures used as lures for the Demonspawn, and returned them to their liege. Sigmund promptly sold off these last bits of lucre to treat his followers to the finest vittles. \r\n\r\nSigmund the boy-baron would go on to rule long and well, still the same genial and generous soul in old age that he had been in the darkest days of the Age of Hellfire.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6550#static": "Many of the High Elves’ great scholars, warriors, and tradesmen cultivate an air of mystery to enhance their prestige, but the notorious Aravian sniper Aleksandr the Sharpshooter is one of the rare few whose secrets are protected by the state itself. Within the vast and meticulous census and immigration archives of Aravia there is no Elf bearing that name. In the corridors of power his name is never spoken, and his orders are given through layers of masque and cryptology. When the Aravian state is pressed on the matter by an unusually persistent inquirer, a wall of complex legal procedures and endless redirection ensures the long-lived Elves can most probably wait the problem out. If feeding the seeker into their bureaucratic machinery is not feasible, other options to silence them are deployed. \r\n\r\nClassified though his details are, the name of the Sharpshooter strikes fear around Teleria. Anyone who has ever traveled anywhere near Aravian lands, or listened to an Elven bard in a tavern elsewhere, has heard tales of his incomparable aim. He is undoubtedly among the greatest snipers ever to walk Teleria, tested in many well-documented high-stakes battles. His arrows seem to travel at the speed of lighting and strike with a frosty, agonizing force. Massive brutes, nimble skulkers, and the most skilled enemy bowmen seeking to test their nerve against the best: all are easy prey for Aleksandr’s extraordinary twitch reflexes, sensory alertness, and tactical awareness. He assesses and visualizes the terrain of the battlefield to use every angle, corner, distraction, and element of cover to full advantage. He serves the Kingdom of Aravia both in the field and as an instructor of the most elite High Elf archers, individuals kept in the same void of secrecy as he. \r\n\r\nSome of the secret details of Aleksandr’s life are concealed not because they are compromising, or truly disgraceful, but because they are inconsistent, stumbling, sometimes painful and imperfect – unacceptable for public knowledge, if Aleksandr the Sharpshooter is to remain an unimpeachable symbol of fear and respect. Yet the enriching details would let so many empathize all the more with the person behind the legend, if only the information could be disseminated successfully.\r\n\r\nAleksandr learned rime-shot magics in his youth in the ice-bound Winterlands, where the only residents were the Norr diehards of Port Wraith and scattered unaffiliated groups of raiders and sellswords. Among these itinerant marauders there were many small, tightly-knit bands who fought and plundered together, competing for spoils. Aleksandr, one of few High Elves to spend any considerable time there, bounced between various gangs. They helped him develop his talent, but he found it all but impossible to find a place among them, and often felt exploited. \r\n\r\nThrough sheer tenacity Aleksandr eventually found a crew with whom he formed a thriving partnership, and was poised to become a famous reaver. But this did not give him the fulfillment he sought. Worse, with his skill on their side in battle, his shipmates became brazen, ruthless, and ambitious. When they proposed not just robbery but slaving, targeting civilian vessels indiscriminately, Aleksandr quietly fled at their next port of call and betrayed the covenant he had with them. Another heavily repressed fact about Aleksandr is that despite his troubled past and supremely lethal stock-in-trade, he is a good-hearted and clear-headed soul. \r\n\r\nNonetheless Aleksandr could not deny that his talent and his future lay in battle and blood, in the twang of sinewy bowstring and lethally whistling arrows. He returned to Aravian shores alone and brooding, and was quickly detained and questioned. When found to be an undocumented High Elf of unsavory extraction, he was not turned away, for the High Elves accept new arrivals so long as they are put in their proper place. Thus he was given a choice between status as a second-class citizen or a chance to prove himself via military service. It was that, or outlawry, and a return to statelessness. With some regret at the loss of his autonomy but faint hope that he might finally feel a sense of belonging, he agreed. The imperious government Elves could scarcely have imagined at that moment what they had gained.\r\n\r\nMany years passed, and Aleksandr grew from a prodigy with huge potential into a genuine master. There are now thousands of veterans of battles all across Anhelt who live in lingering fear of long corridors, wide-open spaces, unconstrained sightlines, and the dread sound of a bowstring’s recoil – all thanks to Aleksandr and his disciples.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6580#static": "Few servants of the Mikage were as feared as the Crimson Horn, Nogoryo. Though a mere man, he was the only being to survive apprenticeship to the aged Blademaster Shan, himself the last living practitioner of a host of ancient Dawnlander martial arts. All the covert crafts – spying and infiltration, sabotage, misdirection, and assassination – were well-known to Nogoryo, and the Mikage used him to his fullest extent. He was employed as a hidden blade to end those who challenged the Autocracy, especially after parts of Yakai began to rebel. \r\n\r\nNogoryo delighted in his dark trade, especially the satisfaction of a successful kill. He relished his reputation, and the fear experienced by those who became aware that he was hunting them. The Mikage might have successfully used him for many years, had greed and jealousy not taken hold of Nogoryo’s masters.\r\n\r\nThe assassin’s deadly work brought him to the attention of the Mikage’s most senior leadership. This was not the blessing it might at first have appeared, for one Demon in particular became fixated on the idea of claiming Nogoryo’s body and using him as a vessel to wreak devastation across Teleria. Nogoryo was ordered to submit to a Mikage ritual that would see the Demon enter into his body. At first, Nogoryo did not protest, for the claims that conjoining with a Demon brought great power were generally believed by the Mikage’s footsoldiers and servants.\r\n\r\nThe night before the ritual was to be enacted, Nogoryo’s sleep was disturbed by a vivid dream. A beautiful woman, blazing with radiant light, came to the assassin. She warned him that he had been misled, and was about to be betrayed. Demons did not always cohabit with a host’s original soul. Nogoryo’s spirit was to be torn from his flesh, his form used as a vessel while his own consciousness was left to disintegrate into nothingness.\r\n\r\nNogoryo tried to deny the truth of what the woman said, but she made no answer. He started awake, and found his tent still suffused for a few moments with the woman’s otherworldly light. As he pondered what he had been told, he also became aware of noises outside – a Mikage soldier, judging by the rattling of armor, come to stand guard. Why would he be present, if Nogoryo was not a prisoner?\r\n\r\nNogoryo took action. After luring the guard into his tent, he killed him silently and took his armor, while making the corpse appear like his own sleeping form. He then stole the swiftest horse in the camp and slipped away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his escape was discovered, the forces of the Autocracy launched a ferocious pursuit. Over the weeks that followed Nogoryo slew or evaded both Mikage troops and a number of assassins who had been tasked with hunting him down. While exalting in the thrill of the deadly pursuit, he also knew they he could not remain within Yakai and avoid the Mikage alone indefinitely. At the same time, he was aware that if any within the forces of the rebellion identified him, they would likely kill him on sight, rather than believe that he had truly abandoned the Autocracy. Hunted and harried by both sides, Nogoryo became a phantom, a legend told to keep unruly children in line or to earn coins after a fine tavern retelling. Whether or not he survived the rebellion and the fall of the Mikage is uncertain, but some claim he still stalks Yakai, a merciless killer who has broken the constraints of mortality, in exchange for fealty to the one who saved his soul from annihilation.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6640#static": "The kingdom of Kaerok has rarely known a time without war and, at times, conflicts in bordering regions have spilled into the realm, causing great hardship and upheaval. During times such as these come opportunities for those of lower birth to rise to greatness, as it did after the War of the Elves, when a power vacuum engulfed Northridge, a poor, hilly region north of Durham Forest. Sensing just such an opportunity, a border lord in Kaerok sent his most experienced knight to seize the land. The knight’s name was Kalvalax, and though he was no noble, he’d earned his knighthood through great strength and determination. As he was commanded, Kalvalax led his army through Northridge, conquering every settlement he came across. All those who refused to surrender, Kalvalax killed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Kalvalax’s lord, the king of Kaerok did not reward him for sending Kalvalax to fight on his behalf. Instead, the king declared Kalvalax Baron of Northridge, rewarding his efforts with the task of controlling this new, wild frontier. Free of his lord’s whims, Kalvalax finally had people to call his own. Kalvalax had made clear enemies of the Elves of Durham Forest by this point, and his fellow barons in Kaerok envied him for his rapid rise to power. Even so, Kalvalax ruled his people with an iron fist and governed his province for many seasons. While his people merely survived, Kalvalax himself prospered. \r\n\r\nOne day, a virulent plague swept through Kalvalax’s barony. Houses and small holdings, along with their infected dwellers, were burned to the ground. But the burning failed to stop the spread of disease and seeing no other way to survive, Kalvalax walled himself within his castle, barring the gates against the plague’s grasp. He hoped that while his barony might collapse, his court at least would live to take any survivors through the crisis.\r\n\r\nIn the barony’s darkest hour, a stranger, shrouded in robes of black, arrived at Kalvalax's castle. Being an old man, he was unafraid of the plague, and asked at the gate to speak with Kalvalax, promising he had something the baron would wish to know. The stranger made his offer: he could cure this lethal plague, and Kalvalax’s barony would be saved. Kalvalax cared greatly for his land – without it, he would be nothing, another landless knight. Desperate to keep it, Kalvalax agreed to carry out the stranger’s plan.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Kalvalax opened his gates, and ordered his troops to gather people from throughout the barony. It didn’t matter if they were healthy or sick, rich or poor, man, woman, or child. Eventually, all the people they could muster were gathered in Kalvalax’s castle's square, where his scribes etched magical runes into the cobblestones at the stranger’s direction. When at last everything was in place, Kalvalax raised his fist and gave the order. His soldiers surrounded the people in the square and leveled their weapons at them. Spearmen slaughtered families with thrusts of their weapons, while bowmen perched on the rooftops shot into the hysterical crowd. As the blood of Kalvalax’s people flooded the square, it splashed onto the runes. Kalvalax watched as the runes began to glow a vivid green.\r\n\r\nAs the last victim fell dead, the final rune was lit with a sickly, emerald glow. The stranger said that the magic was drawing the plague’s power to the castle. Now it bathed the castle in light, blinding all around. Kalvalax's sight quickly returned and his heart became filled with joy, seeing the baleful light encircling his castle. Surely the spell was working. The sacrifice of his people would not be in vain. He was desperate to believe.\r\n\r\nBut Kalvalax's joy became agony as the light shot into his body, infusing him with all the plague’s grotesque pestilence. On and on, Kalvalax screamed, his body racked with agony. As the pain finally faded, he opened his eyes, and his body was radiant with power beyond his wildest dreams. With his new power, something stirred within his heart – he no longer cared about the plague. To the horror of his men, Kalvalax gazed upon the pile of corpses and laughed. The stranger offered Kalvalax his hand in an unspoken offer of greater power. The knight took it, and together they left his ruined home behind.\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed, reports of an Undead knight spread throughout Kaerok. This imposing figure bore Kalvalax’s eyes, but they glowed a toxic green, and it killed without remorse. Nobody knows who the stranger who corrupted Kalvalax was, but one thing seems certain. The Kalvalax that ruled Northridge was long gone. All that remained was an avatar of corruption, a literal revenant knight whose only desire now was to spread grim death in its wake.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6650#static": "Vlad grew up in a Sacred Order orphanage, a harsh and uncompromising existence, and it was only through his kinship with a fellow orphan, the brave and bold Konstantin, that Vlad endured. Together they later became knights of the Order, and saw each other as brothers.\r\n\r\nVlad fell short of knightly ideals. Besides indulging in youthful practices that the puritanical Order frowned upon, he increasingly believed that the Order was hypocritical, even corrupt. Vlad’s struggles were made worse by the fact that Konstantin reveled in the Order’s uncompromising mindset. The two drifted apart.\r\n\r\nMatters came to a head when Vlad discovered a senior member of the Order had been pocketing donations supposed to be used for the relief of the poor. Vlad’s accusations fell on deaf ears, and even Konstantin refused to believe him, claiming a high-ranking member of the Order would never stoop so low. Vlad decided that he could endure this hypocrisy no more, renouncing his knighthood.\r\n\r\nVlad served as a mercenary for years until entering the employ of one Count Aluncar, who ruled over the Kaerok fiefdom of Torovia. Aluncar was old, and his estates were falling into disrepair. He sought a family heirloom, a sword said to be able to grant immortality. While doubting such a weapon existed, Vlad agreed to accompany the count in exchange for his coin.\r\n\r\nAn ancient map discovered in Aluncar’s castle vault led them to a tomb high in the neighboring Redspike Mountains. To Vlad’s shock, they found a wicked-looking blade. Aluncar took up the sword and declared his quest a success. He returned to his castle with Vlad, and it soon seemed he had shrugged off the worst of the age and exhaustion afflicting him. Aluncar offered to make Vlad his chief retainer, with a handsome payment for each year of service.\r\n\r\nVlad was deeply intrigued by the sword. It rarely left Aluncar’s grasp, and nor was it long before Vlad noticed the count had new, unusual habits. He became increasingly nocturnal and withdrawn, refusing to eat or meet with other members of the Kaerok nobility. Rumors also spread that servants within the castle were disappearing. Vlad’s Order-trained suspicions were aroused.\r\n\r\nVlad observed the count’s night-time movements and, eventually, caught him in the act of attacking a cook. Aluncar had been infected by the Crimson Hunger, the vampiric curse of Siroth. In his feeding frenzy, the count had discarded his sword, and when Vlad confronted him the vampire swiped aside the warrior’s weapon with monstrous speed and strength. In desperation, Vlad snatched up the count’s blade, and decapitated him in the fight that followed.\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to Vlad, the hilt of the sword contained slender, poisoned needles that pricked his skin as he grasped it. He was overcome by agony, and while he tried to fight it, he received a vision of Siroth. The God of Shadows offered to save Vlad from imminent death, in exchange for fealty via the Crimson Hunger. Seeing no other choice, and believing he could perhaps fight the dark urges of vampirism, he agreed. Unfortunately, he was not the only one who had noticed the darkness that had fallen on Torovia in the previous months.\r\n\r\nDays later, a Sacred Order Inquisitor came to the province, guarded by none other than Vlad’s childhood 'brother', Konstantin. He demanded that Vlad explain what had become of Aluncar, and when he refused, Konstantin ordered him to surrender his sword.\r\n\r\nVlad realized that as soon as Konstantin grasped the weapon, he too would suffer from its curse. Wishing to save his old friend from such a fate, but also not daring to admit that he himself now bore a link to Siroth, Vlad refused. The argument escalated, with the Inquisitor accompanying Konstantin claiming that Vlad had been corrupted and had murdered Aluncar.\r\n\r\nHis righteous anger stoked, Konstantin drew his sword, the fiery light of Lumaya blazing across it. The friends clashed, old disputes reigniting with fierce passion. They battled relentlessly, Konstantin’s sword, blessed by the Sacred Order, ringing again and again off Vlad’s cursed blade. Neither showed restraint as they put every ounce of strength and skill into slaying their opponent, the duel taking them through the castle’s great hall, along corridors, and up the stairs of the keep. \r\n\r\nUltimately Konstantin prevailed, cutting down Vlad in the north tower and leaving him for dead. He did not know of Vlad’s pact with Siroth, and the vampire rose the next night. He found the castle burned, its inhabitants as well as those of the nearby village slaughtered by the inquisitor, purged just for their unwitting association with him. A bitter vengefulness rose up in Vlad, convincing him he had made the right choice in swearing to Siroth. The next time he met Konstantin, he would show his former brother what it truly meant to battle a creature of the night.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6670#static": "There is no doubt that the hardships of Konstantin’s childhood molded him into the man he became. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised under the stern austerity of the Sacred Order. Life for all children in an Order orphanage was difficult, but fractionally less so for those who found friendship. Konstantin was fortunate in that regard, for he formed a close bond with a boy called Vlad, who had been abandoned on the Sacred Order’s doorstep on the same day as him. They were like brothers.\r\n\r\nThe two did their best to fulfill the oaths they had sworn, to obey their superiors and love the light of Lumaya, but digressed after they reached their coming of age and became Sacred Order knights. Vlad struggled with the rigorous standards, at least when it came to righteousness, integrity, and purity of purpose, while Konstantin embraced them. He remained unfazed by the contradictions slowly becoming evident, that the Order were not always the selfless guardians of the weak that they portrayed themselves as. If time in the orphanage had taught Konstantin anything, it was that Teleria was no easy place to live, and that the occasionally difficult decision was also the right one. Such principles enabled him to look past the problems of the Order and focus on its higher ideals.\r\n\r\nThe Sisterhood of Illumination also helped to stop Konstantin from straying. A convent of Lumaya worshipers with close ties to the Sacred Order, the Sisterhood sponsored Konstantin when he first won his spurs as a knight. When times became especially difficult, he withdrew to their convent and sought the solace of prayer. He was drawn in particular to the convent’s most prized relic, an ancient blade called the Sword of Suns, that was said to blaze with the purest light of day if grasped by one who was worthy and righteous. Konstantin longed to take the blade, but considered himself undeserving of it.\r\n\r\nThat all changed when he rode to the convent after a particularly vexing assignment to discover its doors broken in and blood upon the steps. To his horror, Konstantin discovered that a vampire had attacked the Sisterhood in the dead of night, and was feasting on them within.\r\n\r\nKonstantin charged to the rescue of those who still lived but, alone, struggled to defeat the fast and strong creature. In his desperation, he snatched up the Sword of Suns. Fire blazed across the blade’s length, and brilliant holy illumination spread through the convent. The vampiric monster’s flesh began to burn and, wracked with pain, the beast could do little to ward away Konstantin’s vengeful blows.\r\n\r\nThe surviving Sisters blessed Konstantin’s use of the flaming sword, and he embarked upon his quests with new vigor. From that day forth, he was known as the Dayborn, for he carried the brilliance of the midday sun wherever he went. Years passed until he received a command from the Sacred Order, which directed him and an inquisitor to a little-known province on the edge of the Redspike Mountains called Torovia. There he found his old childhood 'brother', Vlad, who had departed from the Order and, after working as a sell-sword, had been employed by the count of Torovia. Rumors persisted of a darkness at the heart of the province.\r\n\r\nKonstantin wished for the stories the inquisitor was told of Torovia’s miserable villages to be mere gossip, but it soon became apparent that they were true. Konstantin was greeted by Vlad in the count’s castle, his old comrade claiming that the old man had recently perished. Vlad refused to explain how, or to hand over the count’s sword, a weapon the local peasants had claimed was cursed. Konstantin begged his old friend to see the light, but Vlad refused, seemingly sick of Konstantin’s self-righteousness. He raised the count’s weapon against Konstantin, who drew the Sword of Suns. The pair clashed, and it wasn’t long before their desperate duel raged through the castle, sending servants scattering. The pair battled to the north tower, where Konstantin finally bested his old friend and, in a moment of stoic determination, ran him through. At the inquisitor’s instruction, the castle and the surrounding villages were set ablaze, and the sword Vlad had refused to part with was left to be destroyed in holy fire. Konstantin departed, heart heavy, but resolute in the belief that he had done what was right.\r\n\r\nLittle did Konstantin realize that just as the clash had set him firmly on the path of Light, so had it guaranteed that Vlad would walk the path of darkness, for his end was not as absolute as Konstantin had first believed. The two would meet again.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6690#static": "Raf-Matab is a Nomad of the Dusk Hills that lie between the western coast of Peltas and the scorching Krokhan Desert. His people are unobtrusive and nonviolent compared to the Norr caravan raiders of the Deadlands and the Krokhan Nomads who, lacking pasture, subsist on plunder and rustling. They venerate both the Goddess Lumaya and a host of local spirits who embody the land, sea, sky, stone, grass, and hearth. The Dusk tribes tell of a faint pale blue spirit-glow that can sometimes be seen around certain rock formations, streams, trees, or even the whole landscape, a sure sign that the spirits have manifested.\r\n\r\nRaf-Matab was once a shepherd and had just come of age when one night a raiding party of Krokhan Nomads descended upon him and his flock. By the time Raf heard the frantic bleating of animals and the cries of the attackers, the raiders were already tearing open the flaps of his tent. They aimed to abduct and enslave Raf, and so at first tried not to injure him. But he resisted furiously and wounded one of the Krokhaners, provoking the wounded man to kick a brazier full of hot coals directly at his face. Matab was left scarred and blinded, and the raiders abandoned him, his value as a slave now ruined. They left Raf writhing in pain on the dirt floor of his yurt. The coals smoldered against the hide and wood of the tent until it ignited.\r\n\r\nAs the raiders escaped, they saw a light rise from behind them, where they had left their victim – not the orange glow of the burning yurt, but a pale cerulean brighter than fire, brighter than the moon, as bright as a sun. They turned and saw the valley aglow with that strange shining color, and fear and awe shook them. They fled precipitously, some abandoning their stolen livestock, even as the glow slowly faded. After a day, Raf’s tribesmen came searching for him, and found the burned ruins of his tent and the ground trampled by the many boots of the raiders. But they did not find Raf, dead or alive. They did not see him for three months, and when he returned, he was changed. \r\n\r\nRaf strode forth from the scrubland adorned with a crown of bone and antler and pauldrons of furs, his eyes shrouded with cloth. Yet he moved confidently, as though still sighted. As his kinfolk gathered in amazement he stood by the communal bonfire to address them, and told them of the raid and his disfigurement at the raiders’ hands. He said that just when he felt the heat of the burning tent and resigned himself to death, he suddenly could see again, but not as others see. He saw the world as the spirits do, a world of flickering azure flame and glowing hearts. He was reborn, spirit-touched, and had spent the time since in communion with the powers of the land, training his new sight and strengthening his body. He had been blessed for a purpose, a dreamy yearning of the spirits that lingered in his thoughts: he had to obtain what he called the Elderspear and the Shield of the Clans. To do this, he would have to once again go on a voyage, but to where, he was not yet sure.\r\n\r\nThe people's joy at Raf-Matab’s return turning bittersweet, they agreed that he should heed the spirits’ call. And so he ventured away, deep into the Dusk Hills once again, for a year and a day. Following signs from his patrons only he could see, he delved into a cave deep beneath the earth. Therein lay the artifacts, protected by twisted Fae that had been touched by Darkness and insanity, who hoarded them in the depths. By his own humble hunting spear Raf-Matab slew the creatures as they swarmed him, and he claimed the relics that glowed like beacons before his spirit-sight. When he emerged, he bore an engraved shield of exquisite beauty and a cross-hilt spear of enchanted bronze, that both shone with the pale blue light of clan myth, visible to any and all. \r\n\r\nRaf-Matab told his people of his adventure, and they were shocked to learn that guardian Fae could be twisted into murderous lurking monsters. Raf, armed with his relics, proclaimed his new quest to be the pursuit of such Fae abominations that may exist elsewhere, and to purify the land where the spirit-glow emanates the foul taint of Darkness. He traveled north along the coast, stopping along the way to investigate local legends and rumors about mysterious child-snatchers and chittering night-horrors. Near the Valdemar Strait he rooted out and defeated the flesh-eating Hag of Blymmis, and the world at large began to take note of Raf-Matab the monster-slayer.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6700#static": "Before they were known as Shadowkin, the Dawnlanders of Yakai were made up of many different clans, each with their own hierarchy and ruler. In this regimented society, ceremonies, such as marriages, funerals, and festivals, played an important role in maintaining social harmony. As such, their various rules were strictly enforced, and to break them incurred the most severe of punishments. So it was in the case of Gamuran, the lowly stable boy caught gazing upon his lord’s daughter on the day of her wedding. For his transgression, his eyes were put out, so that they may never again look upon that which they were not worthy to see. \r\n\r\nLeft scarred and furious at his treatment, hatred toward the rulers of Yakai grew in Gamuran’s heart. When the Demonspawn ushered in the age of the Mikage Autocracy, he was one of the first mortals to pledge themselves to Siroth. Though he wished for his sight to be restored in his ascendance to Demonhood, he was bestowed with a gift far greater: the ability to see one’s strength of conviction. This Demonic power made him invaluable to the Mikage, as in an instant he would know whether an individual could be turned to their cause or trusted. He became a judge, jury, and executioner of the regime, and countless prisoners were brought to him one by one to determine whether or not they could be of use. Thousands died on Gamuran’s command, but many more lived, as he saw the weakness in their will that would lead to their servitude. As the Mikage’s power grew, so too did Gamuran’s, and he rose to become a highly senior figure. Weaponizing his gifts in order to gain more influence, he falsely asserted a lack of conviction in his rivals to ruthlessly dispose of any who might challenge him. At the height of the Mikage regime, Gamuran was among the most powerful beings in all of Yakai, a far cry from the lowly stable boy who was blinded for daring to gaze upon a noble’s daughter. \r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Mikage, Gamuran was unrepentant. Unwilling to give up the power he had claimed, he continued his work for Siroth with renewed vigor. Taking his most loyal followers and fleeing the reach of the insurgent rebels, he began to build a new order. He knew there would be many across Yakai who felt lost and confused after the destruction of the Autocracy, and who did not trust the new rebel leadership. Preying upon these insecurities, and using his Demonic gift to find those who could most easily be manipulated, Gamuran formed a cult around himself. Its numbers swelled to thousands as people were drawn to his preaching, finding solace in his explanation of how they had been failed by the rebels, and how none but him could see the true direction of where their society was heading. Throughout Yakai, word spread underground of the vitriolic speaker around whom the shunned and forgotten coalesced, a leader bent on ridding the region of the rebel sickness. This was the birth of the Fellowship of Truesight. Building the cult firmly in his own image, Gamuran commanded that all who would follow him must partake in the ritual removal of their eyes, so as to ‘better see the truth’.\r\n\r\nWhile he has far greater ambitions that concern regions beyond even the borders of Yakai, for now, Gamuran must contend with survival. Fearful of both the rebels and fellow exiled Mikage who remember his scheming, he keeps his Fellowship of Truesight relatively hidden, skulking among the shadows, recruiting those who feel at a loss in this new world. As his army of blinded followers grows, Gamuran plots, and waits for the opportunity to restore himself to power in Yakai. When he feels he has a number truly capable of challenging the rebel leadership, and subjugating any remaining Mikage Demonspawn who would dare defy him, he will present his army to Siroth, and ask for gifts and reinforcements to aid him in his ascension. With an army of devout Demonic followers that Siroth could provide, all in Yakai will surely fall to his will, and those who will not serve him will be slaughtered. Perhaps then, when he has a whole nation at his mercy, the lowly stable boy who was brutally punished for daring to act above his station will finally feel his need for power has been satisfied.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6710#static": "The Ogryn known as Guurda Bogbrew began life as the daughter of the brewmistress of the Gutfiller tribe, Gorga Twice-Swill, whose duty it was to concoct the intoxicants popular among so many Ogryn tribes. It takes a great deal to get most Ogryn drunk, and brewmasters and mistresses have long been renowned for their ability to distill just about any organic matter into something alcoholic. Guurda followed in her mother’s footsteps.\r\n\r\nThese skills served Guurda well when the Gutfillers were called up to join an army of the Gaellen Pact near the Sorrowlakes. At first, Gorga and Guurda helped keep the troops in good spirits, but then an Orc general took exception to one particularly rowdy episode between his warriors and the Gutfillers, and the tribe were ordered to leave. Gorga demanded that she be paid for the supplies the army had already consumed, but was refused. Though furious, she could not see a way to pursue her claim any further – her daughter, however, had a more direct means of retribution in mind. Young and headstrong, Guurda poisoned the drinks of the army's commanders that night, and many of them died after the Gutfillers had already set off. She later admitted her actions to her mother. Although initially angry, Gorga came round – Guurda had tried to uphold the honor of the tribe and brewmistresses everywhere, and that was what mattered.\r\n\r\nHowever, a combined force of outraged Orcs and Lizardmen pursued the Gutfillers and fell upon them in a ferocious assault. In the ensuing melee, Gorga and most of the tribe were killed while the distraught Guurda fled into nearby marshes.\r\n\r\nGuurda wandered alone for a long time, inconsolable and desolate. She worked her way deep into the Sorrowlakes, where she was reduced to consuming bog flora and fauna to survive. As she became increasingly knowledgeable about the nature of the swamps, she took up brewing again, albeit by making use of all manner of festering, turgid forms of moss and mud-plant.\r\n\r\nHer unnatural diet, combined with increasingly strange brewing experiments, began to wreak changes upon the stout Ogryn woman. Guurda’s flabby flesh, deprived of sunlight amid the marshland fogs, became pallid and waxen, while her innards turned truly toxic, prone to all manner of festering, gaseous releases. Stories about her spread through the Sorrowlakes, especially among Ogryn.\r\n\r\nEventually, one of Guurda’s kin sought her out, one of the few Gutfillers who survived the clash. He told her that her mother would surely be proud of the new ground she had broken in the art of the brew, but that it would do her no good to sit and rot in the murk and mire of the Sorrowlakes. It was a big world beyond the marshes, and if Guurda was going to do the memory of Gorga and the other lost Gutfillers proud, she should venture out into it and seek to rebuild the tribe, and her family’s legacy.\r\n\r\nInspired, and having already rediscovered her desire to master the art of brewing, Guurda agreed, wanting to spread her knowledge and reforge her tribe. The two Ogryn set out into wider Peltas, slowly attracting a following of other destitute or scattered Ogryn who saw in Guurda not just a brewmistress, but also a leader. After several years, she – now known among her new kin as Guurda Bogbrew – had established a caravan that traveled the continents providing alcohol and entertainment for the Ogryn tribes, and anyone else willing to try Guurda’s powerful concoctions. So potent are they that the bizarre mixture of near-deadly elixirs Guurda has consumed has miraculously extended her life – though well over two centuries have passed since she first learned the way of the brew, she remains hale and hearty, her Ogryn insides only toughened by the long decades of exposure to toxic substances.\r\n\r\nSome claim that Guurda continues what she started with the Gaellen Pact generals, spreading her poisons across the lands, but in her defense, the line between strong, gut-melting drink and actual poison is a slender one. The influence she holds over a large number of Ogryn is strong, and growing, blurring the distinction between her role as brewmistress and that of a full tribal chieftain. If it is power Guurda seeks, she is well on her way to acquiring it. All that remains is to declare that the Gutfillers have risen once more, and are ready to reclaim their place as one of the great Ogryn tribes.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6740#static": "There are many pirates who ply their trade in the southern seas. The Lost Isles are scattered with old Dragonkin Empire ruins that offer plentiful shelter for pirate crews to call home, and a place where they can avoid unwanted eyes. From these strongholds, reavers plunder the rich convoys that trade between Yakai, Velyzar, and the Free Cities of Anhelt. While many pirates have earned their fortune in the Lost Isles, fortune is a fickle thing. The higher one climbs, the further one can to fall, and few appear to have fallen as far as Mithrala Lifebane.\r\n\r\nMithrala began her journey poor in resources, but rich in ambition. Forced to flee her home of Durham Forest with her band of thieves, she took her band to the high seas to escape her vengeful victims. After carving out a name for herself as a pirate, she forged an alliance with Rissix the Seeker – a veteran marauder of the Lost Isles. From that day, the Kingdom of Pirates was born. With Rissix’s charisma and Mithrala’s talent, they accomplished great things together, including establishing the port of Bleakhaven. What began as a business partnership prospered into a wealthy trading empire, ruled by Rissix and Mithrala as its king and queen.\r\n\r\nEven the greatest of empires can reach too far. Hungry for glory, Mithrala and Rissix dared attack the Dwarven Treasure Fleets of the Skyiron Dominion – each one a great prize. While the pirates were formidable fighters, and Rissix and Mithrala genius commanders, their lightly armed vessels were no match for the iron warships of the Dwarves, or that race’s sheer tenacity. In the brutal war, the Dwarves shattered the Kingdom of Pirates, with Mithrala's flagship retreating from the final battle in flames, while Rissix was last seen fighting aboard his doomed vessel, surrounded by foes. That, so they say, was the end of the King and Queen of pirates, and another victory for Alundi Seabreaker, the Skyiron Admiral, reputedly the greatest hydromancer to ever live.\r\n\r\nDespite this defeat, some say that it was not the end of the pirate kingdom. To this day, Bleakhaven remains a vital holdout to the pirates of the southern seas. Many believe that the final battle between the Kingdom of Pirates and the Dwarves was not the end of Bleakhaven’s rulers, either. Some claim that Mithrala repaired her flagship, and pursued Alundi, following him to the heart of the Void Reef. Others swear that Rissix the Seeker did not perish, but instead was captured by Alundi, who used him to help locate a vast treasure buried within the Lost Isles. Tellers of this tale never fail to mention the massive vortex at the center of the Void Reef, which some claim was not always there, and suggest that only a hydromancer could have created it. Nobody knows what truly lies within, for most sea captains dare not draw close. All who know of Mithrala Lifebane however know that she would feel no fear plunging her ship into such a place.\r\n\r\nSeparately, there are those who claim they have seen the dreaded pirate queen stalking the high seas, no longer truly a Dark Elf. They say her ship is manned by a ghostly crew, her form has been twisted by forces no storyteller can determine, and that she plagues the trade routes, killing all in her path and seeking vengeance against the Dwarves of the Skyiron Dominion. Never forgetting the Pirate War, Skyiron’s fleets sail with additional guards, and they are fearful of ambush by her revenant vessel. None doubt she will destroy any ship that crosses her path – no matter whom they may belong to.\r\n\r\nThese are only stories. The high sea is a cruel mistress, and sailors often see things as they ply the waves. No port has seen Mithrala for years, alive or dead. Nobody knows the truth.  Some say there are no ghost ships. No sea-demons. No curses. The Lost Isles are thick with jungles, ruins, and pirates, but no vengeful, undead corsair queens have been confirmed. So people say.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6750#static": "While it is a challenge to find any modern preacher of the Sacred Order willing to say it, the old records do not lie. Lumaya's own immortal Firstborn – the Lightbringers – once fought at the head of the Order. Dusty, rotting tomes buried in libraries in Velyzar, Aravia, and Yakai all proclaim the names of these otherworldly warriors, reciting their deeds with pride, and quoting their adherence to the Sacred Order's dictates. The Lightbringers have long since abandoned the Sacred Order, however, and one of their number is Gliseah. Head ringed with an auric halo and laurel, clad in golden armor, possessed of wings seemingly made of razor-sharp blades and ice crystals, and wielding a magical spear called Icepiercer, she has been an enemy of evil since the Great Divorce.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Sacred Order, few Lightbringers could match Gliseah's zeal in fighting the forces of Darkness. For years, she was one of the heads of the Sacred Order's militant forces, combating Demonspawn and Undead wherever they emerged. Under her watch, the Sacred Order prospered, welcoming in rogue bands of would-be heroes, and training them to be fine, faithful warriors. Despite her success, Gliseah’s single-minded commitment to duty made her inflexible, and her discipline could not be matched by her mortal comrades – or even by some Lightbringers. Ultimately, she gave her position of supreme commander to a trustworthy mortal, and her fellow Lightbringers agreed to obey the new leader’s commands.\r\n\r\nAt first this change was successful, but as time passed, the Sacred Order changed, transforming from the organization the Arbiter had created. Its preachings against the Skinwalkers grew harsher and harsher, climaxing in the Red Crusade in which not only did warriors of the Order slaughter and banish Skinwalkers, but Lizardmen, Orcs, and Ogryn as well. It was this event that caused Gliseah to leave the Sacred Order out of shame. She flew north, alone, in search of others who may have had the same change of heart. After many years, Gliseah arrived at a frozen lake, drawn by the sound of battle. On one side roared a magnificent beast of ice and rime, back to back with a towering warrior clad in plate armor, wearing a crimson, fur-lined coat, and armed with an immense greatsword. Encircling them were a number of individuals. They were draped in black robes, wreathed in dark magical energy, and followed by hordes of shuffling Undead who seemed to obey their every whim. Necromancers.\r\n\r\nGliseah dived down to the aid of the beast and the warrior. Together, the three fought and slew the necromancers, after which their few remaining Undead collapsed to the ground, inanimate. After the battle, Gliseah marveled as the beast talked with great knowledge and kindness. He called himself Tatura Rimehide, and Gliseah learned that he had spent many years observing Teleria, and defending the Winterlands from Demonspawn and necromantic incursions. The warrior was another Lightbringer, called Sir Nicholas. He told Gliseah of his mighty hall in the Winterlands, from which he protected the region against the forces of evil. Gliseah was overjoyed upon hearing his tale, for his kindness and righteousness were legendary and she told him she had hoped to find someone like him, like herself.\r\n\r\nTogether, these heroes talked of events across Teleria. Gliseah spoke of her sadness and rage following Sacred Order's Red Crusade, and talked of her decision to turn from the world. Bonding with Sir Nicholas and Tatura Rimehide, Gliseah found a renewed desire to fight injustice wherever she found it. Defending the Winterlands together, this mythical trio continues to be spoken of in legends that give hope to the innocent and the suffering, and cautionary tales to all who would seek to do evil.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6760#static": "Magic exists in every corner of Teleria. It is in the world's very essence, and has endured throughout its history. Magic lives inside living things of all ages and races, whether children, newly born into the world with gifts that no-one understands, or great and powerful beasts that have been revered for centuries. Magics reside everywhere, and it gives life to all things in Teleria. Some can be comprehended, some are deeply misunderstood, and some are beyond all mortal knowledge. It is the last of these that dwells within the creature known as Tatura Rimehide – a creature whose magic is one of wisdom, grace, and benevolence.\r\n\r\nA mighty, winged, and leonine chimera of ice and rime, Tatura cuts a striking figure wherever he prowls. His skin is pale blue, made brighter by the sheen of his golden armor and mask. Any enemy unfortunate enough to find themselves before Tatura's charge is run through with horns of razor-sharp ice. An ancient beast, Tatura has witnessed almost all of Teleria's history. He was there during the first wars between Lumaya and Siroth. He watched as the mortal races claimed their places in the world and created kingdoms, and he observed those same kingdoms fought with one another over ‘petty things’ during the Age of Treachery while Siroth plotted his return.\r\n\r\nThe conflicts of the mortal races during the Age of Treachery gave many Demonspawn and necromancers space and time to pursue their nefarious schemes without persecution. The Winterlands, Tatura’s home, was sparsely populated and rumors told of ancient powers hidden there that evil forces sought out. Demonspawn incursions became more frequent, and necromancers stalked the snowy wastes, with retinues of Undead raised from Teleria’s many battlefields. Tatura fended them off as best as he could for years, fighting beside the few Norr people who lived there or, very often, alone. Though Tatura was successful in countless battles, his strength waned as time drew on, and each attack was increasingly likely to be his last. His strength had been pushed to breaking point when another coterie of necromancers attacked the Winterlands with hosts of thralls, and forced Tatura to retreat.\r\n\r\nThey caught up with him at a frozen lake surrounded by towering mountains. The necromancers’ shambling hordes closed in on him as a massive snowstorm whipped up. Though weakened by years of struggle and fierce fighting, Tatura stood firm, expecting this to be his final battle. But it was not to be. Through the blizzard strode a mighty figure draped in a red coat, clad in a suit of plate armor embossed with an image of a great stag, and bearing a colossal sword on his shoulder. With a warm smile on his white-bearded face, he told Tatura hope was not lost, and that Light could yet win out. They fought together, back to back, for an hour, cutting down the minions of Darkness. Both were hard-pressed when another stranger appeared – a winged angel, armored in gold, wielding a long spear. She descended from the skies shrouded in electric-blue lightning, slamming into the Undead. Tatura was emboldened once again, and fought with a strength he had not felt in his weary muscles for many years, tearing apart zombies, ghouls, and wights with his claws.\r\n\r\nTogether, these three warriors – Sir Nicholas, Gliseah Soulguide, and Tatura Rimehide – destroyed the necromantic horrors around them and slaughtered their evil masters, securing the safety of the Winterlands for another day. When the last of their enemies had fallen, the warriors spoke together. They shared grim tidings from the south, and Tatura spoke of his observations from his centuries of living. They decided they would band together to protect the Winterlands from any future incursions and, if needed, go to the aid of the rest of Teleria if tidings became dark indeed. Glad to have found friendship, Tatura returned with the warriors to Sir Nicholas' hall, which became his new home.\r\n\r\nTogether, Tatura, Sir Nicholas, and Gliseah have become figureheads of resistance against the machinations of Siroth in the Winterlands, and symbols of hope to all who dwell there. Many times have they traveled further afield when their strength and courage has been desperately needed, rallying the hopeless and relieving the besieged across Anhelt and Peltas. Time and time again, Tatura has seen the strength of the mortal races tested and proven against the forces of Darkness, and no longer does he dismiss them so readily as he has in the past. He knows that, when the time comes, enough of them will always stand firm against whatever onslaught Siroth might have prepared to cast against them. And Tatura will be proud to fight by their side.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6770#static": "Chaagur’s spawn-mother has a great deal to answer for. Born into a brood in the sewers of the Free City of Arnoc, Chaagur grew up to be just one of the teeming thousands of Lizardmen that infest the settlement’s underbelly. Life there is cheap, and those who do not belong to one of the many gangs swiftly become outcasts.\r\n\r\nChaagur might have turned into just another cutthroat sluice-runner, or hired muscle, were it not for the stories he was told as a spawnling, stories that went on to shape both his personality and fate. Chaagur’s mother enjoyed spinning tall tales to her offspring, perhaps trying to shield them from the brutality of life beneath Arnoc. She spoke of far-off lands and wondrous places, but most of all, she told them accounts of a time before so many of their kind had been reduced to a criminal underclass, an age gone by when they not only possessed freedom, wealth, and stability, but also strength and power. She told them of the days of the Dragonkin Empire, and none listened more intently than Chaagur. He listened so carefully because, when speaking to him alone, his mother told him of the dragons. Wise, powerful, winged creatures. Chaagur himself had wings, a rare trait among Lizardmen, prized in history but now regarded with suspicion, for his people had forgotten so much of their once glorious past. He could not help but feel special, important.\r\n\r\nChaagur took the stories to heart and kept them close, making them a source of comfort and inspiration throughout the difficulties he endured. He believed desperately that they were more than mere fables, that his mother’s accounts were true retellings of the past of his people, a time when their empire had spanned the world and guaranteed peace and prosperity for all. The reason for the empire’s eventual defeat had been left nebulous, blamed on treachery and shortsightedness. Surely a time would come when the Lizardmen would realize how far they had fallen and seek to renew their old glories?\r\n\r\nAs he came of age, Chaagur swiftly proved himself in Arnoc’s underworld, earning a reputation as a skilled blade for hire, deadly with his twin swords. He worked for a number of gangs, his abilities earning him respect, but always he longed for something more. As he played his part in the brutalities plaguing life in the Free City, he became disgusted with what he saw as the degeneration of his people. There had to be another way, a future beyond the greed, crime, and impoverishment.\r\n\r\nChaagur began to cause trouble, claiming that the Lizardmen of Arnoc needed to change their ways. Even worse, he styled himself as the one who was going to bring about that change, who could unite his people and lead them into a new and enlightened future. Understandably, such an attitude did not sit well with Arnoc’s under-lords and crime-broods. It wasn’t long before Chaagur’s work dried up, and that was followed by a slew of assassination attempts that the Lizardman barely survived.\r\n\r\nChaagur realized that Arnoc was not ready for change. Worse, he knew that his rabble-rousing was putting his own brood-kin, especially his mother, in danger. It was with a heavy heart that he chose to flee the city, fixing his hopes on a new beginning. Among her fables, Chaagur’s mother had often told him of the distant Sorrowlakes of Peltas, home to the largest Lizardmen population in Teleria. If Arnoc was not ready for a return of the Dragonkin Empire, perhaps the clans of the Sorrowlakes would be.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Arnoc was long and arduous, but the aggression Chaagur suffered from Human villagers, roving Skinwalkers, and traveling priests merely hardened his resolve. Having never known anything other than the sewers of the Free City, he naively believed that the leaders of the Sorrowlakes would see him as a savior. Instead he discovered a Lizardmen society little different from the desperate backstabbing and scrounging of Arnoc. The clans were beset by disunity and infighting over the Sorrowlakes’ sparse resources. The realization filled Chaagur with sorrow, but he refused to give up on what he saw as his life’s purpose.\r\n\r\nSince arriving in the Sorrowlakes, Chaagur has worked tirelessly to unite the Lizardmen clans and remind them of their former strength and majesty. As in Arnoc, there is much resistance, but not all scorn his efforts. The former gang swordsman has skill and charisma, and some lesser tribes and leaderless bands have rallied to him. Each new follower only reinforces Chaagur’s determination. He is convinced that greatness is beckoning him on, and he will not stop until he is slain or his peoples are reunited and reigning once again.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6820#static": "Growing up a butcher’s son was hardly an auspicious beginning to the life of one of the Yakai Rebellion’s most infamous figures. Jingwon’s father was pressed into service by the Mikage Autocracy as a cook for its armies. Jingwon was an apprentice to his father, focusing on learning his cuts and perfecting his stews as a means of surviving the misery and brutality of the ongoing war against the revolution sweeping Yakai.\r\n\r\nJingwon’s father passed away not long after his son came of age, and Jingwon was given no choice other than to take up where his father had left off. He grew strong, hefting carcasses and hacking bone, and learned the best way to slaughter and butcher, how best to cleave flesh or hack open throats. Soon he was leading the cooks assigned to the army of the Mikage general Zenshi the Talon.\r\n\r\nEven among the Demonspawn, Zenshi was an infamously cruel and uncompromising commander. A hulking brute, he led campaigns through pro-rebellion areas, torching villages and killing indiscriminately. Throughout it, Jingwon's heart hardened as he was an unwilling witness to the violence the Mikage so readily employed.\r\n\r\nZenshi’s depredations drew an uncompromising response from the rebellion. Guerrillas struck the army’s supply lines, harried its flanks mercilessly, and brutalized those they captured. The Mikage vanguard would pass through new territory, only to find the scouts they had thought were ranging ahead to be nailed to trees along the roadside. There were three separate assassination attempts on Zenshi, and many of his lieutenants were eliminated.\r\n\r\nZenshi’s army quickly deteriorated, with many of the mortals that made up the main body of the soldiery deserting, which only made Zenshi more ruthless. Those caught fleeing were tortured before being publicly executed. Discontent swept the lower ranks, a feeling which Jingwon shared. With supplies lacking, and with most of the surrounding countryside torched, he had no food to feed Zenshi’s host. He had never wished to serve the Mikage in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe final straw came when Zenshi issued his vilest command to date. Aware of the supply problems, he ordered cannibalistic decimation – one in ten of the common soldiers were to be killed and consumed by their comrades, an order greeted with revulsion by even the most battle-hardened of the Autocracy’s Human warriors.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Zenshi held a council of the army’s few surviving commanders, many of them dining on the last, hoarded food. Zenshi had the temerity to complain about what Jingwon was serving, and the butcher’s son flewinto a starved rage. Snatching Zenshi’s great war ax, he cleaved the Demonspawn’s hand off where it rested upon the table, and roared at him to feast on that if he so wished.\r\n\r\nWhen Zenshi’s lieutenants bellowed at the starved Human guards to seize Jingwon, the mortals instead drew their swords against the Demonspawn. After a ferocious struggle, Jingwon emerged from the council with Zenshi’s bloodied helmet held aloft, and gave a great cry of triumph. Desperate mortals who witnessed this, realizing what was occurring, rallied to him and turned on their masters, and rebellion swept through the camp. By the end of the fighting, all those loyal to Zenshi had been killed or driven off. The surviving mortals elected Jingwon as their leader. He claimed much of Zenshi’s armor, including his great horned helm. He also took up the Demonspawn’s ax and shield, nailing Zenshi’s severed hand to it, before declaring his intention to join the rebellion.\r\n\r\nYears passed, with Jingwon trading in his butcher’s trade for the deadlier butchery of the battlefield, discovering that they were not so different. The leaders of the rebellion were impressed not only by his size and the skill with which he wielded his ax, but also by his cold willingness to strike down the rebellion’s enemies, whoever they were. He established himself as an enforcer, responsible for the difficult task of suppressing the inevitable internal difficulties and differences that plagued such a major uprising. It was said that he would leave Zenshi’s hand outside the tents of any threatening the rebellion with disharmony, and that waking up to the sight of the trophy was enough to quell almost any hint of unrest.\r\n\r\nJingwon’s duties only grew more vital after the rebellion finally triumphed. The rebellion’s leaders set about consolidating their strength and removing any outliers who might threaten the stability of the new kingdom, even among those they had once fought alongside. Jingwon was the perfect tool for the new establishment – nothing could be allowed to threaten the rebellion’s legacy, lest the Autocracy return. \r\n\r\nZenshi’s severed hand remained a potent symbol of authority in Yakai, but traitors were not Jingwon’s only concern. It was only a matter of time before Zenshi returned, and the former butcher’s son looked forward to the day when he could add Zenshi’s second hand to the first.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6830#static": "It has been many centuries since the Fae cast Opardin out of the Mistwood, and as Opardin says little about his past, only a few in Frostheim know of his origins, let alone the reason for his banishment. But while the cause remains a mystery, some have tried to document his journey to Frostheim. Stories have it that Opardin wandered listlessly for many weeks without caring for himself, as he was made distant from the Rhythm of the Mistwood, that he sailed east across the sea to the western coast of Anhelt, and wandered from there into the Redspike Mountains. Weakened by his travels, Opardin was taken in by a village of the Norr, whose people themselves had been driven from their home, the Winterlands. Opardin’s ashen skin, horned head, and monstrous size made him distrusted among his hosts, but their hospitable nature obliged them to take him in. Grateful, Opardin worked hard to repay their kindness.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before Opardin’s ability in battle won over his doubters. He could crush a man’s skull with his bare hands, and could sweep swathes of enemies aside with mighty swings of his heavy golden hammers – Ibex and Ram – weapons tempered with magic spells so they could never be broken. The sound of these hammers thumping down on his luckless victims could be heard above the din of battle, and he soon became greatly feared by the enemies of his adopted people and admired by those he fought beside. \r\n\r\nThough Opardin suffered many wounds, he bore no scars because his true power is rejuvenation – and with a few magic words in his Fae tongue, could heal the injuries and cure the illnesses of others. Some of his adopted people dared suggest he was a Lightbringer, gifted by Lumaya to protect the Norr after they fled the Winterlands. A handful of souls – almost entirely enemies, claimed he was a Demonspawn of Siroth, yet none proved it then and only the most embittered and malicious souls have had desire to over the centuries since. \r\n\r\nA creature of few words, Opardin made little conversation with his people and, together with his great strength, this caused them to believe him empty headed, if faithful and kind. But as time passed, the Norr noticed that though he said little, what he spoke was full of timely wisdom, and the clan’s leaders began to seek his counsel on matters of importance. He went on to befriend and serve Elder Skarg, and when the legendary man died, it was Opardin who crowned his successor. The Fae was recognized as a friend to all Frostheim, and he found purpose he never thought he would find after his banishment from the Mistwood. For centuries he was a watchful counselor to Frostheim’s six kings, until the fateful day when the Ice Golem stormed the Winter Hall, and killed them all. Opardin was not present that day, for he had been sent to save several of their sons, lost after their hunting party was caught in an avalanche. Afterwards, when the Confederation was replaced with a kingdom, he swore to serve the king and queen forever more. To this day he still does so, with the title of Clanfather.\r\n\r\nWhen Opardin speaks, his advice is almost always followed. Such is the trust placed in him that he has been granted the power to strip any Frostheim monarch of their crown should he deem it necessary – in his many centuries as Clanfather, he has exercised that power on just three occasions. Rarely does the ruling monarch travel without him at their side, and the looming Fae is ever behind the throne at court. Yet this does not cause fear in the people of Frostheim, far from it, for they cannot conceive of what their realm would be like without the Clanfather. As far as they are concerned he not only watches over the monarch, but over them, too. His temperance and diplomacy steer Frostheim's rulers with a steadiness that keeps the kingdom prosperous, and the people safe. Despite his great age, time has taken nothing from him – his body remains as powerful as the day he left the Mistwood and his healing powers are just as potent. And his dedication to his people has never faltered.",

He is a tall man, clad in piecemeal armor and a battered coat, his mouth sewn shut with coarse, black string. His scarred features are eerily blank, even as he wields his sword and war-pick in battle, hacking down his foes with brutal efficiency. \r\n\r\nFew know Holsring, save by reputation. He rarely stays in one place for long, preferring his own company to that of others. Even on the rare occasions that he seeks sanctuary in a chapterhouse of the Sacred Order, he rarely mingles with the inhabitants, choosing instead to spend his time alone, in silent meditation. Or perhaps, as some believe, in contemplation of his many sins.\r\n\r\nJust what those sins might be, none truly know their full extent. There are rumors, of course. There are always rumors surrounding men like Holsring. Some believe that he was once a witchfinder; an inquisitor tasked with rooting out heretics and Skinwalker covens. Others claim he suffers under a vow of silence for some ancient treachery or murderous act; that his wandering is not by choice, but an act of penance. A few believe that he is not a man at all, but instead one of the Lightbringers – the divine servants of Lumaya, incarnated in mortal form. \r\n\r\nNo one knows the truth of Holsring’s identity, save the man himself. On the few occasions that an inquisitive – not to mention courageous – Witness has tried to broach the subject with the silent wanderer, they have received no answer save an unsettling stare. Even his age is up for debate, for there are certain records dating back to the founding of the Sacred Order itself that mention a warrior suspiciously similar in appearance and demeanor to Holsring as being present during both the Second Great War and the Red Crusade. \r\n\r\nRegardless of his origins, Holsring is not well-loved by the leadership of the Sacred Order. While he is not considered an out and out renegade, he is never welcomed in the chapterhouses and monasteries where he seeks shelter. And for good reason – his silent presence has an unnerving effect on those around him. Many of those who have endured an evening in proximity to Holsring complain of nightmares the next morning. Those who have spent more than a few days in his company often suffer from sleepless nights and persistent fears of being watched or hunted by something – or someone – they cannot name. \r\n\r\nThankfully, to those who might accompany him or fight beside him, Holsring seems to be aware of his effect on others and does what he can to ameliorate it. He isolates himself where possible, and when that he cannot do that, he departs at the first opportunity – so long as he has accomplished what he came to do. But nothing can make him depart until he has completed his task, be it uncovering a nest of Undead or something much more incomprehensible to those around him. \r\n\r\nHow Holsring identifies what he must do is unknown. But every member of the Sacred Order knows that his presence heralds an unseen threat. Often, Holsring will see to these matters himself. On the rare occasion that he requires aid, he will visit the nearest Sacred Order chapterhouse and communicate his needs to the Deacon or Mother Superior. They will then dispatch as many warriors as they think are required to aid their visitor in his quest, however grudgingly. Holsring never acts as leader of these expeditions, instead leaving such responsibilities to others. Indeed, he barely acknowledges his allies even in the middle of combat, as he advances to where the fighting is thickest. He fights without honor or mercy, chopping through the ranks of the enemy with an unnerving precision and a horrid efficiency that would sicken even the most brutal soldier of the Sacred Order. He batters his foes to the ground, hamstrings them or guts them, leaving them to bleed out. To Holsring, an enemy is merely an obstacle – something to be removed as quickly as possible. And when the battle is done, and the task complete, he departs without a sign of thanks. \r\n\r\nIt is a credit to Holsring that despite his grim reputation, he is never refused in his requests for assistance or sanctuary. The masters of the Sacred Order understand that a warrior like Holsring is an invaluable asset, despite his off-putting manner. Though he is not their most beloved servant, he is a faithful one, and a proven enemy of Darkness is all its many guises. The Sacred Order has precious few of those in these troubled times.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6880#static": "Long has the wisdom of Boragar the Elder guided the fate of the Skyiron Dominion. Indeed, so deeply entwined with the Dwarf kingdom’s future is the venerable runekeeper that some claim that he will only perish when the mountains crumble and fall, bringing an end to Dwarf-kind and the world itself.\r\n\r\nAncient records, of which Boragar himself is the foremost keeper, tell that he was born into a long lineage of runekeepers, those Dwarves who show a particular affinity for the language of runescript and have also learned to harness its magical properties for the betterment of their kin. It is not without good reason that many runekeepers also hold roles as advisors or royal confidants, for the learning required to master their craft leaves them with a knowledge few bar the Elven scholars of Aravia can match.\r\n\r\nTheir role is an important one, for advice is often needed in the Skyiron Dominion. Though claiming to be a kingdom occupying the great range of the Cloudspire Mountains, in truth the cantons that comprise the Dwarven state are run in semi-autonomously. While they appear to be unified in the face of outsiders, it was common – and, indeed, encouraged – practice for the various jurisdictions to compete with one another, laying claim to contested mines and vying for production and trade. A good deal of negotiation was therefore required among the various jarls, kings and nobles that comprised the Dominion’s ruling elite. In this regard, the runekeepers have always been invaluable, not only giving advice but acting as go-betweens and keeping relationships smooth.\r\n\r\nBoragar was born into such a life. When his father, himself an aged and highly-respected caster, passed away, Boragar assumed his duties as chief councilor to Elg Goldbeard, jarl of one of the Dominion’s largest and wealthiest cantons. And Boragar ensured it remained wealthy. He took on more and more duties, rising through the apprenticeships of the runecast rites to become a master, and notably being installed as the Stave Bearer of the Moot, the overseer of the great council that brought together cantons to form overarching Skyiron policy and settle wider debts and debates.\r\n\r\nBoragar came to be considered one of the greatest Dwarves then living in the Dominion, respected throughout the cantons. Besides his measured council, he was also responsible for training new generations of runekeepers in the twinned arts of magic and diplomacy, keeping them as a caste above party politics. Despite such authority, Boragar never overreached the limits of his roles, and confined himself to charting the ongoing prosperity of the cantons he served.\r\n\r\nOver time, external events tested Boragar’s abilities. The power of the Mikage Autocracy to the east and war between the Telerian League and the Gaellen Pact put great strain on the Skyiron Dominion. It was Boragar who helped mediate the creation of the Nyresan Union. To the Sylvan he is known as Boragar of the Golden Face, after the ceremonial Mask of a Thousand Ancestors that he wears when representing the Skyiron Dominion abroad.\r\n\r\nThe world continued to change, and conflict seemed to be the only constant. While Boragar’s direction opened the Dominion to trade to others beside Gloomdeep Hold, it has also made the peaceful and wealthy future of the Dwarves more fraught. Bringing seclusion to an end always creates uncertainty, and expanding trade also guarantees more disputes and attracts unwanted attention and jealousy from other powers. Boragar has no intention of standing by and running the risk that events will outpace him, even at his venerable age.\r\n\r\nFeeling that he had spent too long advising from the feast halls and throne rooms of the Dominion, Boragar has taken up the Rune Stave of the Moot and his golden mask. He now ventures forth with Dominion expeditions and diplomats throughout Teleria, sharing the values of the Dwarven way. In doing so, he will help to impose the will of the greatest Dwarf kingdom beyond the Cloudspire Mountains. As war rages in Anhelt, guidance and wisdom are needed more than ever, and few are better able to provide it than Boragar. The aged Dwarf knows in his heart that it is not only the fate of his people that will soon hang in the balance, but that of all Teleria.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6890#static": "Karato never knew his parents. He was taken from them as a young child by the dreaded Mikage Autocracy, who had seized control of Yakai and subjugated much of it to their evil ways. Claimed by the Mikage, Karato was doomed to serve them, growing up in their fighting pits and war-cages.\r\n\r\nAs he came of age, Karato showed a particular affinity not for combat in its rawest forms, but for the art of hunting. One Mikage general, Zau Ri, apprenticed him to his chief tracker. It became Karato’s duty to hunt down those who defied the rule of the Mikage, be they simple peasants who had fled having not paid their taxes, or the steadily growing number of rebel bands that were instigating resistance against their Siroth-serving overlords.\r\n\r\nKarato swiftly added a number of successes to his name. At Yellow Rock Gorge he led a force of Mikage soldiers in tracking down one particularly wily force of bandits, even after his tracker master had been slain in an earlier ambush. For this, Karato was promoted to the role of Zau Ri’s chief huntsman.\r\n\r\nThe Mikage sought to not only crush the spirit of freedom amongst the common folk of Yakai, but also to extinguish the spirit of the land as well. Nothing personified Yakai more than the famous mystic foxes – or kitsune – that inhabited the verdant woodlands of that region. As creatures imbued with a mischievous magical essence, the shapeshifting foxes had long been a part of Yakai’s folklore, and were the subject of a thousand tales regarding their cunning and the good fortune they bestowed. Neither aggressive nor warlike, the foxes were nevertheless viewed as anathema by the Mikage, who ordered their extermination.\r\n\r\nKarato was thus employed to stalk Yakai and bring death to the foxes. This was a particularly sad irony, as the only memory he had of his parents as a child, before the fighting pits, was of his mother telling him stories of the mischievous foxes before bed-time. Struggling to repress such memories, which were the dearest he had, he set about his hunt. To Zau Ri’s annoyance, he always gifted his victims a quick, clean death, and buried the bodies reverently.\r\n\r\nEventually, likely sensing his reluctance and wishing to test him, the Mikage assigned Karato his most difficult assignment to date. The Autocracy had become determined to hunt down one of the oldest and wiliest of the mystic foxes, Yumeko. This would truly be a test of Karato Foxhunter’s abilities. For months he tracked the female through the forests, knowing he needed just one second with his bow to make the kill. For her part, Yumeko seemed aware of Karato’s efforts, as well as his reputation. She taunted the huntsman, offering him half-glimpses of herself before slipping away, or leaving behind markings on trees that mocked him. Though initially frustrated, Karato steadily grew to enjoy the effort of the chase, admiring his quarry.\r\n\r\nEventually, one had to give. Driven from her home among the woodlands she was most familiar with, Yumeko was finally cornered on the edge of a forest. Only then, with the shivering, starving female in his sights, did Karato finally falter. Though he had nocked an arrow, he found he could not draw the string. Instead, he collapsed into his erstwhile prey’s arms, weeping as memories of his childhood and a lifetime of dark deeds done at the behest of evil beings overwhelmed him.\r\n\r\nYumeko told him that it was not her place to forgive Karato his crimes, but that she would accompany him upon the difficult path to redemption. Their first act together was to lure Zau Ri into the woods, where Karato claimed he had taken the infamous Yumeko’s head. Instead, by the day’s end it was Zau Ri’s decapitated body that adorned the entrance to the forest.\r\n\r\nThe two joined the growing rebellion against the Mikage, in which they became heroes. Alone, each was a deadly foe, but together their speed and cunning was unmatched. They slew the Autocracy warlord Shar Lai in his castle without alerting one of his guards. Alongside a rebel force led an entire division of Mikage warriors into a series of ambushes in the western woodlands, eventually causing the mortal warriors, outraged at the indifference of their Demonspawn masters to their losses, to desert. When finally the evil of the Mikage was driven from Yakai, the pair retired for a while to live together in the forests, but Karato could not find peace. Taking up his sword and bow once again, he resolved to venture across Teleria and continue to right wrongs wherever he found them. Yumeko went with him, the fox and the hunter now living together in perfect harmony.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6900#static": "There are few creatures in Teleria more enigmatic than the mystic foxes of Yakai. Born out of the chaos of the Dance of Darkness, the exact nature of these shapeshifting creatures is a point of some debate. Perhaps they were once lesser shards of Lumaya’s light, sent spinning free during the Dance and allowed to roam through the ancient woodlands. Others say that the foxes are the spirit of the land itself, the essence of the Dawnlands – of Yakai – made into flesh and blood. Others still declare that the foxes have always been there in one or another of their many forms, since the First Dawn. Certainly the idea that the foxes are in some way bound to Yakai, to its verdant forests and mountains and streams, seems to hold some weight, for only a few are known to have ever traveled beyond its borders. One of those few is Yumeko.\r\n\r\nYumeko is a peaceful and furtive being, and though her guiles were well-known, few indeed were those who could claim to have set eyes upon her. That changed during the dark days of the Mikage Autocracy, when beings loyal to the Shadow God seized control of Yakai. The Mikage sought not only to kill and enslave the common people of the region, but to bend the land itself to their will. The forests were hacked down, the rivers were dammed, and the mountains were cruelly scarred with mines.\r\n\r\nAs part of the war the Mikage waged against the spirit of the Dawnlands, the foxes too became targets. Hunting parties ruthlessly tracked down and slew Yumeko’s kind, their lush tails becoming trophies pinned to the armor and shields of brutal Mikage warlords. Though under the threat of extinction, their non-confrontational and peaceful nature meant that few sought to fight back, until Yumeko met Karato.\r\n\r\nAmong the hunters employed by the Mikage, none were as feared as Karato. No fox had ever escaped his bow or blade. Yet Yumeko detected something in him so many others missed. After one of his hunts, she concealed herself close to where he had slain one of her kin. She was shocked to observe Karato kneeling over the slain fox and murmuring a prayer, asking for forgiveness, hoping that the fox’s spirit would know he had not acted out of hatred and malice. Yumeko realized that Karato was a reluctant killer, surely shaped as much by his upbringing and circumstances as she was shaped by the forests.\r\n\r\nWhen Karato came for Yumeko, she hoped that by refusing to fight him she would bring out his reluctance, and perhaps show him that the path he walked was the wrong one. She led him on a chase that took them across half of Yakai. Despite the fact that he was a killer of her kind, Yumeko’s taunting of her pursuer was always good-natured and playful. She knew that there was a chance to break a chain of violence for good. Karato would awake from a night’s slumber to find Yumeko had carved his name and likeness into the bark of the tree he had been sleeping under, or the name of the next location she was traveling to spelled out in leaves and branches across the trail.\r\n\r\nThe hunt had to end eventually. Yumeko was slowly but surely driven from familiar territory, starving and exhausted. Karato finally cornered her on the edge of the mountains bordering western Yakai. It was only then, staring at her, with his arrow nocked, that the infamous Foxhunter finally broke down. Admitting his terrible deeds, he begged Yumeko for forgiveness. She admitted that the past could not be undone, but that it was possible to avoid further suffering in the future. They joined those rebelling against the Mikage, Yumeko reluctantly putting aside her refusal to harm others in an effort to stop the evil infecting the land. She and Karato soon came to trust and respect one another, as they found their talents, as fox and hunter, naturally played to one another’s strengths. As they shared the struggle against the Mikage, they discovered their partnership growing into something more, Karato enamored by Yumeko’s wits and spirit while she cleaved to his calm certainty and carefully-guarded inner kindness. \r\n\r\nAfter the fall of the Mikage, Yumeko and Karato might have known peace, retiring to the forests together, but Karato could not shake off the feeling that he had still not absolved himself. He set out into wider Teleria with the intention of bringing good to the world. Yumeko loved the Dawnlands, but she had come to realize she loved Karato even more. She chose to accompany him, and from that day forth the story of the fox and the hunter became not just a Yakai fable, but a legend told by all of Teleria.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=6990#static": "With the rise of the Mikage Autocracy, the feudal system that had governed Yakai for generations crumbled. The lords and nobles of the kingdom were all either executed or fled, and in its place a central regime was established. Though nothing ultimately prevented the Mikage from seizing power, there were some who resisted. \r\n\r\nIn the western borderlands, Ginro the Stork was one such individual willing to make the sacrifices necessary to stand against the Mikage. The youngest child of a lesser house, Ginro seemed destined for a life of comfort and ease. Few among the nobility expected him to make much of his life outside of marriage, yet Ginro wanted to earn his status through his own achievements. Forgoing his family’s wishes of betrothal, he instead spent his time diligently training with the spear, honing his technique so that he could wield the weapon with deadly precision. When the newborn son and heir to one of Yakai’s major noble houses was abducted by bandits, Ginro saw the opportunity to prove the righteousness in his decisions. \r\n\r\nFor five days he hunted with little food or sleep, tracking the bandits to their hideout in the Cloudspire Mountains. There Ginro waited until the dead of night, and when the moon was at its highest he slipped into their camp and slit their throats before they could even draw their weapons. He took the captive infant up in his arms and delivered the baby safely back to his family. For this deed, he was pronounced Ginro the Stork, and gifted the decorative mask and feathered armor that became his signature. In time, he married a daughter of that same house, and together they had a child, Sana. \r\n\r\nWhen the Mikage started their purge of Yakai’s nobles, Ginro managed to escape the initial slaughter with his wife and child, though the rest of his family were all massacred. In the verdant Tszua Hills, he took up his family’s crest as its last heir, marshaling his surviving loyal forces. There he refused the call to bow to his new ‘masters’, sending back their messengers without their heads, while planning his retaliation. Over the coming weeks, others who had escaped heard of Ginro's resistance, and his army swelled. As more exiles joined him, and the plan to fight back against the Mikage was vigorously debated, it became clear that one course of action was favored: all-out attack. One great effort to rid Yakai of the Mikage, or death in glory trying. \r\n\r\nKnowing that the Mikage would want to crush any nascent rebellion swiftly, the exiles decided they had to strike first and fast. The date was set for the ramshackle forces to march on Chezoa, the city the Mikage had chosen as their first seat of power, on the first morning of the new moon. The evening before their departure, after many sorrowful farewells, the soldiers’ families were sent away into the Cloudspire Mountains for their safety. Ginro sat down with his daughter Sana to wish her goodbye, the finality of the moment gripping both of them tight. Her tears glistening in the moonlight, she gifted him her doll, telling him to always keep it with him, so that they would never be apart. He kissed her and attached the precious gift to his belt, and later slept full of fear and uncertainty, but steadfast in his belief that he must stand against Siroth’s forces. \r\n\r\nGinro awoke, gripping his spear tightly, when it was still dark. He lay in silence, waiting for dawn to arrive, until his waiting was interrupted by screams, and the clash of steel. His camp was being attacked. He burst out of his tent, launching himself into a storm of blades, screams, and blood. Whirring his spear in a frenzy, he cut down scores of rampaging Mikage Demonspawn, all the while attempting to rally his troops. As countless more Demonspawn joined the bloodshed, Ginro fought with all his might to resist the hopelessness and despair that was spreading. Even as his warriors around him dropped their weapons and begged for their lives he fought, knowing that as long as he stood the glorious kingdom of Yakai would never truly fall. It was this tenacity, this will to face down evil, that prompted the Arbiter’s intervention.\r\n\r\nAppearing before Ginro just as his opponents finally surrounded him, she offered to place his soul into a Shard, so that he may survive, and face down evil once again some day. Knowing that certain death awaited him should he refuse, and that this was the only chance to see his daughter again, Ginro accepted, vowing to help create a better world than the one she had to endure.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7000#static": "The name of Gronjarr has echoed in infamy down centuries of Dwarven history, usually elided with euphemisms such as ‘Fiery-Hands’ and ‘The Drowned.’ His tale is a reminder of the dangers the Dwarven people face living deep underground, for according to the metaphysical laws of Teleria and the other spheres, they are far from the Light of Teleria’s sun, and close to the primordial Darkness that is said to lurk at the center of the world. \r\n\r\nIt was early in the history of Teleria, when the Firstborn of the gods still abided among the mortals of the realm, awesome and terrible. War raged between Lumaya, the Light, and the Shadow that mortals call Siroth in hushed and fearful whispers. These mortals, too, were drawn inevitably into the conflict. The stout and industrious Dwarves were valuable allies. Their finest artisans constructed Lumaya's fortress in the Cloudspire Mountains, that ultimately prevailed through the darkest days of carnage and was later known as the Arbiter's Tower. But there also were Dwarves, the Painsmiths, who heeded the seductive call of Siroth, scorning the overworld of wholesomeness and Light to become wretched apostates in the sunless bowels of their caverns. Centuries after Lumaya and the Arbiter cast the banishment spell, small sects of Dwarves still harbored secret allegiance to Siroth. Among them was Gronjarr, who had always harbored worrisome rage and restlessness in his heart. \r\n\r\nTo make Gronjarr a more perfect instrument of terror, Siroth directed a number of his Painsmiths to prepare a powerful rune-arch, so soaked in blood and magic that even the prodigious soul of a mighty arch-fiend might be siphoned through it and into a mortal body. Gronjarr was given a crown of ever-burning flame, grafted to his head to signify his eternal covenant. The pain was searing, but Gronjarr welcomed it, for he knew it as the loving caress of his infernal master. His flesh thus prepared, he was brought to the sinister rune-arch and bloody sacrifices were made before it, calling a fiendish essence into the Dwarf’s body from the extra-planar hellscape of Anathraad. His gnarled fists erupted with Demonic flame that spread to engulf his massive blade. \r\n\r\nDuring the cataclysm that became known as the Fall of the Dwarves, Gronjarr was tasked with the destruction of the great runescript archives of Gloomdeep Hold, where the Dwarves stored their precious secrets of magic and artifice, and histories dating back to the dawn of their existence. To do this, he was put in command of a traitorous cadre of officers and soldiers within Gloomdeep, a whole company of fighting Dwarves willing to rise up for Siroth when the time was right. The coming of Gronjarr would be their signal to turn on their brethren, an infernal spark to ignite a full-scale assault. They would not be alone. Demonspawn would also fight beside them, bursting through from new portals.\r\n\r\nGronjarr and his turncoat Dwarves stormed the archive, leaving ashen ruin in their wake. Generations of meticulous work, representing uncountable hours of painstaking labor, went up in smoke in minutes. As Gronjarr rampaged through the grand library, he cut down wave after wave of brave defenders, slicing through the heaviest armor with his red-hot steel blade with the same ease that it carved through the parchment and leather bindings of the tomes he laid waste to. The tide of fiery destruction could have gone on to topple the hall of the Mountain King and lay low the whole of Gloomdeep, were it not for a momentous and painful decision made in the darkest hour of the siege by the king and his engineers. \r\n\r\nThe royal machinists threw wide the floodgates and sluices of their great waterworks, and the grand cistern whence the Dwarves got their supply of fresh water was diverted into the lower districts. A huge torrent roared through the halls and tunnels, sweeping away everything in its path. Loyal citizens of Gloomdeep perished alongside the invaders, drowned or pulverized by the force of the water and swirling debris. When the deluge reached Gronjarr, he laughed to see the devastation and death, and stood his ground. The heat of his blazing shroud boiled the water as it gushed over him. For a few moments, the evil Dwarf stood within a bubble of steam as his army was washed away, but he could not long endure, and eventually he too was dragged into the abyss by the merciless floodwaters – a glowing blotch within the watery gloom, hurled into the deepest depths, his fury fruitless.\r\n\r\nIn time, the depths into which Gronjarr was washed were sealed away. But though their memory is long, the Dwarves are ambitious and prone to avarice, and now, many generations later, the ancient seals are being broken as the Dwarves of Gloomdeep Hold dig ever-deeper.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7010#static": "His true face hidden behind a leering mask, Nari the Lucky is a fickle fiend to meet on the road. He loves nothing more than to vex passing travelers with impossible riddles, or challenge them to games of chance where fate's arc seems to always bend toward his will – even in the most unlikely of ways. Should one quibble with Nari's rules or deny him a game, they should expect his vicious scythe to be at their throat, before they can frantically beg to play this trickster's devilish amusements.\r\n\r\nWhere does this freakish luck come from? Nari is said to have once been an adventurer – one who did not follow his Dwarven comrades into the bowels of the earth, but instead one who chose to delight in the wonders of Teleria with endless travel. He indulged in flights of fancy – pursuing fables and rumors about hidden treasures, mysterious spirits, and wondrous places where untold bounty lay. More often than not, these were nothing more than wild goose chases into the back of beyond, but one day, Nari's luck turned.\r\n\r\nOn one grand expedition, he met with a Fae under an eternal rainbow, in possession of a magical pot of gold. The coins from this pot could pay any toll, and would always return to the owner's pocket. Greed overtook Nari's mind, and he challenged the Fae to a battle of wits for one of these magical coins. The Fae agreed, but under one condition – if Nari lost, he would become the pot's new owner, unable to leave its side and spend any of its endless wealth. The two shook hands on the deal and began their game of riddles. The two clashed for a day and a night without respite, each effortlessly parrying the other's mental thrusts. Slowly, Nari tired, but the glittering lucre from the pot stirred him on. Summoning up all of his cunning, he gave the Fae an impossible riddle – an unsolvable conundrum to which even he did not know the answer.\r\n\r\nThe Fae pondered for hours, trying to solve Nari's vexatious puzzle without success. At its wits' end and sick of seeing his opponent's wry grin, it admitted defeat and awarded the canny Dwarf victory. While Nari had kept to the rules of their bout, the Fae seethed at his cunning. In retribution, it hexed the coin it gave Nari with a devious curse. Luck would eternally be on Nari's side, whether he wanted it or not. He would win any game, any quarrel, any argument – but it would never be a clean win. Fate would always conspire to see Nari triumph, but this triumph would always raise his opponent's ire. Even if Nari wished to fail, this coin would refuse him defeat, even when losing might be the right move for his survival.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Nari still wanders Teleria to this day – his cursed treasure bringing him 'luck' wherever he goes, as well as a stream of angry losers who seek vengeance on this masked rogue. He tries desperately to pass off his treasure as the glorious prize for the victor of his devious games, but no challenger can best him, not even death itself. Forever he must wander, in search of a trickster who may finally bring his lucky streak to its end.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7040#static": "The moon has always held a fascination for the Elves of Teleria. Reverence for its light formed a core of the beliefs held by certain lunar cults of Aravia. These beliefs were among those that Siroth manipulated in his guise as the Dreamwalker, and another tool by which he slowly twisted parts of Aravian society to his own ends. \r\n\r\nSiroth fostered the belief that the moon’s light was a revelatory one – that it could be used to reveal the secrets of the universe to one wise enough to parse the shadows it cast. Many an Elf went mad seeking to divine the secrets of this lunar wisdom. \r\n\r\nCromax Moonblood is one of the few Elves to survive his search for the secrets of the moon with body and wits intact – though the latter is a matter of some debate. Obsessed with the Dreamwalker’s promises of ancient wisdom, Cromax scoured Teleria for anything that might allow him to commune with the shadows cast by the moon. He delved into forbidden places, and made pacts with strange beings. He infused his flesh with raw stardust and fed upon the stuff of shadows, but none of it was enough. The answers he sought seemed destined to be ever out of reach. \r\n\r\nFrustrated, he turned his attention to the great observatories built and subsequently abandoned by the Dragonkin after the destruction of their empire during the Age of Hellfire. These structures straddled the heights of the Cloudspire Mountains, and it was said that from their star-platforms a trained astromancer might be able to see constellations otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Built and staffed by Elves, Dwarves, and Dragonkin, the observatories had been considered places of worship by some of the old lunar cults of the Elves, and it was from the surviving writings of those cults, long banned by the rulers of Aravia, that Cromax learned of them.\r\n\r\nCromax sought out these observatories to plunder them for any secrets they might hold. He climbed the sheer peaks, battling cold and wind, as well as Dwarven sentries from the Skyiron Dominion, who watched over the peaks. These wardens guarded the secret passes that led to the observatories, for reasons known only to the Dwarves. Cromax’s encounters with these warriors became so regular – and so bloody – that the Dwarves soon placed a bounty on the Elf’s head. \r\n\r\nBounty hunters flocked to the Cloudspire Mountains. Wherever Cromax went, he soon found himself under attack. But he refused to cease his quest, and set his sights on the highest and oldest of the observatories – a site abandoned long before the others. The scraps of information he’d been able to glean about the place in his search told him little about what might have happened, save that it had claimed the lives of the astromancers who had worked there. \r\n\r\nCromax made the arduous climb to the ruin, unaware that a group of bounty hunters had picked up his trail. His pursuers tracked him to the observatory even as the full moon rose, and cast down its silvery gaze across the shattered husk of the observatory. Cromax found himself entranced by the light, for it was brighter here than anywhere else he had seen on Teleria – and the shadows it cast were darker. Within them, shapes of cosmic blackness danced. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t notice the bounty hunters until it was almost too late. Forced to call upon the most dangerous forms of shadow magic to defend himself, Cromax found that it reacted strangely, as if he had tapped into some wellspring of power… one he could not control. \r\n\r\nNo one knows what truly happened that night, save Cromax. What is known is that cold fire danced across peaks of the Cloudspire Mountains, and that the Elf who came down from the mountain was not the same Elf who’d climbed up. His features were hidden behind a mask belonging to one of the Elven lunar priests of old, and his manner was odd – gone was the determined wayfarer; in his place was a strange thing of moonlight and lunar cycles. \r\n\r\nCromax now wanders Teleria, guided by the waxing and waning moon. He claims to be its envoy, though what exactly that entails none can say. Some believe him mad; but all know better than to stand in his way… especially when the moon is full.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7050#static": "Raised in the tumult of the War of the Elves, Krakarth learned the skills of statecraft and diplomacy first-hand from her father. One of the apostate Dark Elves who worshiped the mysterious Dreamwalker, Krakarth's father turned many unsure nobles against the king of Aravia by weaving a delicate web of intrigue, subterfuge, and blackmail. Despite his diplomatic acumen and charisma, he could not turn the tide of the war in his favor. The Dark Elves were defeated and exiled to Durham Forest, Krakarth and her father among them.\r\n\r\nThe struggle to establish a new home was brutal, for Durham was replete with monstrous predators, food was scarce, and infighting between the Elves was common, but Krakarth learned important lessons in leadership as her father employed his silver tongue and battle scepter to carve out a home for him and his followers. As she grew up, Krakarth joined her father in taming their corner of the forest, negotiating with potential enemies and turning many of them into valued allies. When words failed, Krakarth's military training came to the fore. Over time, Krakarth and her father built a new nation together – they named it Brackenshade.\r\n\r\nAfter many years, Krakarth's father retreated from public view, ill-health confining the once-indomitable statesman to his bed. Krakarth took his place, taking up the ageing diplomat-warrior's battle scepter and donning his fearsome darkiron mask to rule their fiefdom. Under her leadership, Brackenshade became a haven of relative wealth and peace. Insect attacks were uncommon, the borders watched with vigilance. Murder was rare, Krakarth’s hold over her realm as iron as her mask. Wealth was great, for every passing trader sought sanctuary there, and each paid handsomely for the Great Lady of Brackenshade’s protection.\r\n\r\nWord of Krakarth’s success spread far, with Dark Elves and even High Elves pledging their allegiance to this matriarch of the forest. It was not fear or survival instinct that saw them swearing loyalty to her – but admiration for her skill as a statesman and a warrior.\r\n\r\nHigh Elves in Aravia saw Krakarth’s power as both a threat and an opportunity. Dignitaries from several factions came to her in secret, some treating her as a de facto ‘queen’ of Durham whom they believed they could manipulate into sowing further division between the Dark Elves. There were others, however, who while also seeing her as a queen of a kind, came to her hoping that she could help establish peace between the disparate Elven peoples and perhaps even reunify them. She turned all these delegations away. Durham was her home now – the home her and her father had built together. They had no desire to crawl on their knees to seek peace with those who turned them away. If the High Elves wanted reconciliation, they would have to beg her for it, and even then, it might be too late.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7070#static": "The corrupt nature of the Cult of K’Leth means that those in its upper echelons are consumed by the desire for power and the need to retain it. For all but the indispensable Soul Shepherds, there is the perpetual threat that they will one day find themselves mortally wounded with no new body to inhabit. For those without power and influence, this is not an unusual outcome.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, politicking is rife throughout the innermost parts of the cult, and good reputation means a great deal to its members. But there are a few who see past the tribulations involved in trying to hold on to immortality. They prefer to live life as though they are in their last body, to indulge their obsessions rather than waste time scheming. Among their number is Gaius the Gleeful.\r\n\r\nGaius was an odd child, and suffered for it. The son of a knight of Kaerok, he proved highly unsuited to follow in his father’s footsteps and was prone to muttering to himself and giggling at the most inappropriate moments. He was physically unexceptional, and was easy pickings for the sons of other knights who bullied him mercilessly. His bouts of uncontrolled laughter earned him the nickname of Gaius the Gleeful. His father despaired, considering him an embarrassment, and found that his beatings could not drive out his son’s strangeness. \r\n\r\nAs he grew up, Gaius became fascinated by the jesters of Kaerok’s court. He delighted in their antics and outrageous costumes, and was enthralled at the way courtiers – so cold and suspicious of Gaius – giggled and rollicked at their performances. One particular jester grew to be the object of Gaius’ devotions. The jester’s name was Brambles and Gaius attended his every performance. For his part, Brambles indulged the young man’s questions and curiosities in ways no one else had ever bothered to. \r\n\r\nWith this new happiness in his life, it didn’t occur to Gaius that Brambles would have anything at all to do with the series of corpses that had were discovered one month close to court – each with a wide grin carved into the victim’s cheeks. One night after a performance, Gaius sought out Brambles in a castle corridor only to find him disfiguring the corpse of a noblewoman. Shocked and confused, Gaius ran. \r\n\r\nSeeing an opportunity, Brambles raised an alarm, casting the fleeing young man as the murderer. Gaius evaded his pursuers, but knew he could never return to his old life. Stripped of his knighthood and forced to live a life of exile, Gaius came to embrace the role in which he’d been falsely cast. If Brambles wanted to play, then Gaius would prove he could play better.\r\n\r\nPosing as a humble beggar, Gaius returned to Kaerok. It didn’t take him long to find his first victim – a noble’s son who had beaten him as a youth. He murdered the man and cut a smile across his face then left the body in Brambles’ quarters. Then he watched from afar in giggling glee as the jester was seized and dragged away, all the while protesting his innocence. One good performance, it seemed to Gaius, deserved another.\r\n\r\nStill disguised, Gaius attended Brambles’ execution where he overheard a conversation among a number of the nobles. Their topic was the exile of Gaius the Gleeful – not the bloody deeds that they attributed to him, but his silly giggle and misfit ways. Stung that people were still dismissing him, Gaius took his revenge, killing his critics one by one. Playing the role Brambles had cast him in, Gaius became a killer whose legend grew with every murder. It was only through one man’s weakness that Gaius gained the possibility of eternal life as a killer.\r\n\r\nRudolf Marren, ostensibly a wealthy Kaerok merchant, returned home one night to find the leering death-jester waiting for him. Gaius was used to ignoring the pleas and promises of his victim, but Marren had something to bargain with. He told Gaius that he was part of a secret society that had unlocked the secret to immortality. If Gaius would spare him he would induct him into its ranks. In that way, his theater could continue forever.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that Gaius the Gleeful became a member of the Cult of K’Leth. To this day, Gaius indulges his crazed delights across Anhelt – a prancing, giggling nightmare whose tracks are marked by an infamous bloody grin.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7080#static": "For the Dark Elves, loyalty is a precious and rare commodity. Few are those who do not feel ambition’s sting, and fewer still are those who would not betray even their own kin for influence or advantage. But there are some Dark Elves who have made a name for themselves by offering up their loyalty to the highest bidder and never breaking a contract, once accepted. Many of these oddities can often be found acting as bodyguards for anyone who can meet their exorbitant prices. But among their number, one name stands far above the rest: Truath. \r\n\r\nLike many of his peers, Truath began his career as a soldier, although under a different name. He was the leader of a hand-picked elite; veteran warriors, tasked with finding the weak point in an enemy’s battle-line and exploiting it. Thanks to Truath’s almost instinctive grasp of tactics and strategy, his warriors were capable of turning a stalemate into a rout, or breaking through an enemy pincer movement, allowing for the escape of an entire army.\r\n\r\nTruath’s successes on the battlefield did not translate to successes off it, however. Never the most tactful of warriors, Truath made enemies out of his superiors by pointing out the flaws in their strategies. His exploits reflected poorly on them, for Truath’s interventions were credited time and time again for driving home a victory, or saving armies from destruction in the field.\r\n\r\nWhile Truath initially took little notice of his commanders’ resentments, it became impossible to ignore when, at the Battle of Redvine Gorge, he and his warriors were sent forward into the teeth of the Orc enemy with no support, on the orders of a junior officer he’d inadvertently insulted. Truath’s detachment was all but destroyed, and Truath himself was badly wounded.\r\n\r\nBy the time Truath recovered, his commanders' war against the Orcs was all but over. Haunted by the memory of what had happened, Truath changed his name and sought new employment. Lacking the stomach for assassin’s work, and having no talent for skullduggery, Truath found himself selling his services as a bodyguard even as he pondered how best to insure his previous failures were not repeated.\r\n\r\nInitially, Truath’s employers were merchants and minor functionaries, but with every successful contract, his renown grew. Employing the skills he’d acquired in his former life, Truath could single-handedly defeat a pack of hired killers or help his ward evade nearly any ambush with little difficulty. In time, the nobility took note of his skills, and Truath found himself with a whole new sort of clientele, who paid far more than his previous employers. \r\n\r\nAfter one incident involving the rescue of a sorcerer marked for death by his rivals, Truath even received a mystical artifact by way of payment. The deadly Staff of Liferip became his constant companion, and it meant the difference between life and death for him and his clients more than once. The artifact proved to be a boon to his longevity in more ways than one; its sinister magics added the lifespan of its victims to that of its bearer, allowing Truath to extend his life, and indeed those of others if he so wished, decades beyond normal. \r\n\r\nNow moving in rarefied circles, Truath discovered that there was more than one way to defend his charges, and himself. He realized that during his time as a soldier, he’d made the mistake of paying attention only to the battlefield, and none to the political games of his peers and superiors. Determined not to repeat past mistakes, Truath learned everything he could about his clients, and their friends and enemies. He learned the names of their servants and bodyguards, noting those who were open to bribes or threats, and used both to learn what he could about their masters. He took note of the ever-shifting webs of alliances and rivalries, and used what he’d gleaned to his advantage, so as to ensure that he received the best price for his services and was never on the wrong side of opponents too powerful for him to best, in combat or otherwise. \r\n\r\nSoon, Truath was known as the most resourceful, successful, and dangerous bodyguard in all Durham Forest. These days, his renown is such that bidding wars often erupt as nobles vie to enlist his services, and the very rumor that he has been hired by one faction or another has brought at least a public end to innumerable feuds. \r\n\r\nMoreover, Truath’s hard-won knowledge of the ever-fluctuating political networks of Durham Forest have made him far more than just a physical threat to the enemies of those who hire him. It is said that he can cripple a noble house with a well-placed word in a scullery maid’s ear, as easily as he might defeat an assassin in combat.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7090#static": "Just as there are exalted heroes and lowly peons among the mortals, so too is it the case that the Undead Hordes are composed of many small and humble soldiers, and a few rare and powerful overlords who steer the course of the collective. Unlike the fractious, ambitious mortals, the Undead appear to have singular unity and obedience. Their hierarchies are absolute. The history of thousands of battles lend their weight to this being axiomatic. An Undead who dreams of rising above its station is, on principle, absurd.\r\n\r\nYet the idea persists. Perhaps mortals naturally project their own habits, norms, and personalities onto the bizarre and alien minds of those beings who live in death. Against the vast, nameless, faceless Hordes, it may be a psychological need to put a face and a name to Undeath. This explains the ubiquity of the Deathknight, a figure of primal legend that has been a sort of stock character in portrayals of the wars against the Undead. The everyman of the Undead Hordes, the Deathknight is the overworked and under-respected servant of the many dreaded lords of the Undead. Given his symbolic role as the downtrodden skeleton, many wondered if the Deathknight, like themselves, wanted a promotion. More clout, more power, more glory, more gold. Surely the allure of such things transcends even the curse of Undeath.\r\n\r\nThe story goes that the Deathknight, after another day of drudgery and defeat from which he resolutely regenerated his ancient bones, climbed into his coffin to rest. He lamented his lowly stature, his common chores, his nameless toils, his lack of respect. He wished to be made a famous hero, and prayed that it would come to pass. Then, astoundingly, the Arbiter herself appeared before this accursed creature in his meager chambers, and announced that it would be so. But rather than elevate the Deathknight to greatness she simply created a new Deathknight – an Ultimate Deathknight. Was it a rebuke upon the lowly Deathknight for her to twist his intent thusly? A jest? Scholars and theologians caution that the Arbiter, powerful though she be, has not the deific power of absolute creation. But common folk often see the Arbiter as a goddess regardless, even if it is a minor blasphemy. None can say what truly transpired.\r\n\r\nThere soon came to be new sightings of the Deathknight, but a Deathknight transformed, all swagger and glittering gilt plate, bearing a mighty and pristine blade. His armor, engraved with depictions of the rat companion Nibbles that traditionally accompanies the Deathknight, was proof against mighty blows. This Ultimate Deathknight was himself a swordmaster, unrivaled in all his duels. The people did not know whether to fear a new resurgence of Undeath with a more powerful Deathknight at its helm, or if the old Deathknight had been replaced or surpassed. Some said they saw both on the same battlefield, one cringing in the back ranks and the other covered in glory in the thick of the melee. Some claimed the Deathknight and the Ultimate Deathknight were bitter rivals. Others said they were father and son. Some said both, and the Deathknight represents the jealousy of a father surpassed and replaced by his own legacy. Some say the Ultimate Deathknight reconciled with his counterpart, and that although there can be only one Ultimate Deathknight and one not-so-Ultimate Deathknight, they became comrades in arms. The histories are muddled beyond comprehension.\r\n\r\nSurely, all of this wildly creative storytelling bears little resemblance to the facts on the ground, but it is nonetheless a fascinating insight into the minds of the people. If the Deathknight represents the idea that a humble and well-meaning soul could still find some measure of dignity in Undeath – a comforting fantasy – then the Ultimate Deathknight represents the fantasy that fame will not go to one’s head and power will not corrupt that humble soul into an arrogant brute. Both of these mortal obsessions, writ large upon the blank canvas of Undeath’s clean white skull, may yet have caused the manifestation of both types of Deathknight. A popular myth, arising from no particular source but from many common misapprehensions, could be reflected and amplified by its own infamy, until it gives rise to the very phenomenon that produced the myth to begin with. \r\n\r\nOnly the gods can say.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7100#static": "Within the great academy city of Ireth, no magic was considered off limits. Ethics and philosophy? Those were for lesser academics. What mattered was uncovering the secrets to magic and the universe, without being constrained by something as trivial as right or wrong. One of the greatest who ever studied at the Academy, Deliana dedicated her entire life to command the heavens themselves – a life that would engulf her.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, Deliana was fascinated by the beauty of lightning. During Aravia’s potent summer storms, she consumed their energy from her bedroom window as if they sustained her life. To her, lightning was a divine power – an indiscriminate, wild expression of the sky. Her royal heritage meant nothing in comparison to her, and she thirsted to bend the power of lightning to her will. Despite her ambition, her family’s tutors and the library granted her no answers. They were only interested in matters of the earth – not the will of the heavens.\r\n\r\nLeaving her family and heritage behind was a small sacrifice for Deliana to pursue her dream. Arriving in Ireth, she dedicated herself into unlocking the secrets of lightning. Studying meteorology, she learned how to track a storm’s path, and developed specialized equipment to attract a thunderbolt. Most importantly of all, she spent many seasons enchanting her constitution to survive a lightning strike. While other mages within her college could conjure electricity from their hands, this energy was a pale imitation of the real thing. Deliana knew a storm would come eventually, and she had to be prepared.\r\n\r\nFinally, a storm rolled in – Ireth buckled under sheets of rain, while thunder shook the sky. The moment upon her, Deliana tracked the storm to a giant salt pan outside the city. She had to be the only target for this strike, so that the heavenly bolt’s power would ripple through her, and only her. She could taste the storm as she stood in the salt pan, her lightning rod held aloft in anticipation. She waited. And waited. The rain stopped. The clouds slowly parted. Deliana pleaded with the skies, imploring the heavens to strike her. She cursed their name and sank to the floor, clinging to her lightning rod as she wept. She took one last look at the sky, and then – crack.\r\n\r\nThe pain hit Deliana beyond all meaning. For a single moment in time, every fiber of her being crackled with divine life. Her eyes shone the brightest blue as energy danced across her fingertips, but the power did not dissipate. She had become a conduit for the storm, the heaven’s power in mortal form. Its electrical impulses melded with hers, its thoughts becoming hers. She spoke with a voice like thunder: ‘All will know their place in my presence.’ Taking up her lightning rod, Deliana turned away from Ireth and strode into the desert. She would show everyone the true majesty that she now commanded – the power ordained to her by the very heavens itself. Those who would not submit she would blast into submission.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7110#static": "Nekmo Thaar comes from a spawn-lineage of Lizardmen healers, all wise and skilled. Once a practitioner of the ways of restoration in a quiet settlement on the edge of the Sorrowlakes, he might have remained there in peaceful obscurity, tending the elderly and the infirm and teaching his ways to the next generation, were it not for the coming of the Orc warlord Dordrum. The Orc intended to carve out his own fiefdom in Peltas, and decided to claim the village where Thaar lived. Dordrum and his warband descended on the settlement, killing those who resisted and demanding tithes and fealty from those they spared. \r\n\r\nThaar was not a warlike being, and he initially acquiesced. He cared deeply about his fellow-villagers and his community, however, and as the months passed he realized that their subjugation was intolerable. Dordrum took too much, and those who survived his takeover were on the brink of starvation. But what could be done? The villagers were not strong enough to fight Dordrum and his brutes, at least not on an even footing.\r\n\r\nThaar decided to change that. After much thought, he realized that if knew how to heal he also knew how to destroy. A great many of the insects, fish, and plants from the Sorrowlakes that he employed in his medicines also, if prepared or treated differently, or used in excess, possessed toxic or poisonous properties. The physiology of Thaar’s lineage meant that he was able to extract medicinal properties from certain foods in his gullet and turn them into salving liquids that he could excrete via the sharp spines that jutted out of his back. Thaar realized also that, if he ingested more unwholesome meals – from razorleaves and pond-slitherers to rockberries, itch ants, molder sprouts, and more – he could induce the generation of toxins instead.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Thaar had developed a wide array of poisons. He spoke to a number of the leading villagers, describing how he hoped to use these new weapons against the occupiers, and asked whether they would aid him. They agreed.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Thaar poisoned Dordrum’s food. Due to Thaar’s inexperience with poisons, his dosage was not enough to kill the Orc, but ironically it ensured that the warlord was brought before Thaar in his capacity as the local healer. Dordrum’s underlings failed to realize that the tinctures the Lizardman was giving their leader was speeding along his demise. The food and water given to the Orc warriors was likewise laced with contaminants by the villagers, on Thaar’s instructions. By the time the Lizardmen’s oppressors realized what was happening, it was too late.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Thaar and his fellows was tragically short-lived. While Dordrum lay dead, his daughter had been elsewhere, bringing other parts of the Sorrowlakes into her father’s dominion. When she heard of Dordrum’s death she swiftly gathered her own warriors. They descended upon the village, slaughtering all they found, intending to leave no survivors. Thaar narrowly escaped, convinced by the other villagers there was nothing that could be done to save their homes.\r\n\r\nConvinced that he had brought devastation down upon his own people, Thaar wandered the Sorrowlakes before eventually crossing the Valdemar Strait and coming to the Free City of Arnoc. The city’s sewers were infested by impoverished Lizardmen, and amid the lawlessness Thaar found a new purpose. He had tried healing, being a force for good, but all it had wrought was death and destruction. The sights he saw beneath Arnoc did nothing to rebuild his belief in any inherent goodness to the world. Why suffer for doing righteous deeds, when none around him in his new home seemed deserving of them? So it was that Thaar embraced the role of a master of toxins and venoms, a death-dealer who sold out his prodigious talents to the highest bidder. There was no shortage of such individuals in Arnoc, where only the strongest, or the most cunning, survived.\r\n\r\nArnoc’s murderous Lizardmen gangs will do much to win the services of ‘Poison Throat’, the infamous master of venoms who darts through the free city’s crumbling sewers in search of fresh ingredients. The Cult of the Skullsworn in particular court his abilities, though Thaar has never sworn himself to them, nor to the Skinners or any other gang who fight in Arnoc's deadly underworld. Thaar’s refusal to take sides is one of his selling points, but when a small cut festers or fresh food brings on sickness anywhere, it is he who is blamed, a fact that only enhances his reputation. Few know Thaar’s origins, of his days as a kind and humble healer, but that matters not, for that Thaar is now long gone.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7120#static": "In the early days of the Sacred Order, much credence was given to Lumaya's capacity for forgiveness – how even the most wicked souls could be redeemed through her love and grace. Many believed that only a tiny shaft of her Light was needed to pierce the veil of ignorance blinding someone, and the troubled would abandon their wickedness for piety and charity. Such was the case with a man called Jorvik – for he only needed to experience Lumaya's kindness once for him to renounce his avarice and sin, and be reborn as Bivald of the Thorn.\r\n\r\nOnce a bandit king who terrorized the routes around Kaerok's Lands of Rebirth, Jorvik was more mountain than man – unflinching, rugged, and cruel. His band of cutthroats pillaged any caravan they could find, stripping the possessions from anyone whether they were merchants, pilgrims, or nobles. Local garrisons, lordly armies, and even rival bandit groups tried to best Jorvik, but his greed was outmatched only by his ferocity in battle, and he defeated them all. Locals whispered that his treasure hoard could make a dragon jealous and, if he willed it, he could have toppled more than one of Kaerok's fledgling Free Cities with little effort. However, a chance meeting with one pilgrim caravan – apparently no different to any he had attacked before – changed Jorvik's life forever.\r\n\r\nThis humble caravan was transporting no gold or possessions worth speaking of. Its people were making the journey to the Lands of Rebirth, where the Sacred Order had established a stronghold for those willing to absolve themselves of past sin. Enraged by their lack of riches, Jorvik prepared to strike the pilgrims down in cold blood, but an elderly man among their number walked forward, grasped the bandit king’s hand, and looked deep into his eyes. What exactly came to pass has been lost to time – some claim this was just an ordinary man, while others claim he was one of Lumaya's Lightbringers disguised in mortal form.\r\n\r\nWhatever the truth was, Jorvik's face transformed as the man spoke soft words to him. His eyes, it is said, changed from milky blue to ink black, and the whites disappeared. The pilgrim spoke of Lumaya, and that no matter the darkness in Jorvik’s heart, there was always time to repent. Jorvik wept bloody tears, beseeching Lumaya for forgiveness for his myriad crimes. He turned to his former friends and pleaded with them to also beg for Lumaya's mercy. Most of them ran at the sight of their leader sobbing blood and his death-black eyes.\r\n\r\nJorvik beseeched the old man and his fellow pilgrims, asking for their guidance as to how to right his wrongs. They requested that Jorvik accompany them to the Lands of Rebirth, where he would surely find the forgiveness he sought in service to Lumaya. His tears stilled. Wiping the blood from his eyes, Jorvik agreed, and followed the pilgrims into that valley of repentance. It was there that Jorvik was ‘reborn’, his sins washed away by years of devoted service and good deeds. He defended pilgrims from bandits, spent hours reading holy scripture, smote unholy creatures, and helped villagers in times of hardship.\r\n\r\nYet Jorvik's crimes continued to torment him. He prayed, self-flagellated, and fasted, but to no avail – he could not rid himself of his unbearable guilt. He spent many moons examining what he might do to relieve his anguish, and came to many conclusions. First he decided he must always be in pain, and so anointed himself with a wreath of thorns that also acted as a constant demonstration of his penance. Second he bound his eyes, for he was not worthy of looking upon Lumaya’s creations. He decided also that he must become a man of peace, not of war, for he had killed enough. He took up the name of Bivald, that of a martyr of Lumaya famed for his refusal to shed blood, as it might pollute the Goddess’ world, even though it cost him his life.\r\n\r\nBivald set out to become a protector of the caravans entering and leaving the Lands of Rebirth. While he still carried an immense, lavishly decorated war hammer wreathed in barbs, he hoped to never use it. Should bandits attack, he hoped to offer them kindness, mercy, and a way out of the cycle of violence that was shown to him. Bivald hoped maybe, just maybe, that by bringing souls to Lumaya his guilt might be assuaged. But if raiders refused his offer, he saw them worthy only of death, as he was before he saw the Light. Wielding his hammer in a whirlwind of death, he obliterated his enemies, reducing them to little more than a paste of blood, broken bone, and pulverized flesh.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7130#static": "Ragash is a member of the Jiinang Som diaspora, a religio-cultural union originally from northwest Yakai. Often referred to by outsiders as ‘Lovers of Purity’, Jiinang Som demand attention to one’s spiritual health as a constant way of life. In particular, a Jiinang must revere nature and abhor the harm of any living thing. Animals must never be eaten, slain, or abused, and their by-products relied on only if there is no alternative for survival. Even plants must be treated with reverence: crops are thanked for their sacrificial sustenance and loggers must ask forgiveness from the trees they cut and make penance by planting more. Their aspiration of universal kindness even extends to insects and tiny mites. However, only innocent creatures are extended this kindness, and it is always permissible to fight against evil. Ragash, seventh of ten children of two devout Jiinang Som, clove closely to this creed from childhood – before his transformation – tempering his natural exuberance and mischievousness with mindfulness and restraint.\r\n\r\nJiinang Som and their ways were tolerated until the outbreaks of persecution and malevolence that took place during the Age of Treachery. As the Red Crusade gathered force in Anhelt, the Mikage Autocracy began its ascendance in Yakai. Perhaps perceiving the rise of totalitarian misrule earlier than others, the Jiinang Som began a mass exodus just as the tide of public opinion was turning against them, but before it could escalate into violent purges. It proved to be a wise choice – the cruel Demonspawn-influenced autocrats taking over Yakai would have surely crushed them for daring to place the life of a flea or a cat on the same level as their own exalted personages. From this moment in the tales of his people’s history, Ragash learned the importance of discretion. A fight avoided is a fight already won.\r\n\r\nThe Jiinang Som people braved an arduous journey across the Cloudspire Mountains to escape the growing danger in Yakai. When they arrived on the other side, they found the boglands of the Sorrowlakes not empty, as they expected, but populated by the first groups of non-human exiles displaced by the Red Crusade. As more and more of the Jiinang Som settled there, so too did the trickle of frightened and traumatized Orcs, Ogryn, Skinwalkers, and Lizardmen from the west become a flood as the genocide intensified. The Jiinang Som were now among fellow exiles, rather than an intolerant majority group. But there came friction with their new neighbors nevertheless, for the crowded, tense, and often anarchic refugee camps bred petty conflicts constantly. As a result of occasional violent incidents between Jiinang Som and Skinwalkers, the Skinwalker curse afflicted a Jiinang for the first time in their recorded history, and their culture had to adjust to this frightening, yet to some of them intriguing, reality. It was a similar unfortunate encounter with a drunk and belligerent Skinwalker that first changed Ragash himself.\r\n\r\nBy coincidence or some unconscious generational awareness of the possibility, the Jiinang Som strictures were ideal for limiting the spontaneous rise of Skinwalkers and preventing existing Skinwalkers from accumulating more cursed souls. Their vegetarian diet and taboo against animal killing made it easier for Jiinang Som Skinwalkers to remain calm, rational, and in control of their more bestial instincts. While no amount of prayer or practice can reverse the transformation suffered by the afflicted, they had discovered an ideal lifestyle for a Skinwalker who aspired to drift as little as possible from their original self. Thus, it became dogma that Skinwalkers could be Jiinang Som and vice-versa without shame, and that the positive effect of the Jiinang Som lifestyle on Skinwalkers was indicative of its overall spiritual benefits to everyone.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was resolved that Jiinang Som Skinwalkers would be encouraged to train in martial arts, to take advantage of their enhanced physiology for the good of community defense and the promotion of righteousness. Thus began the tradition of the Konmawt Warrior Monks, named after the place in the Sorrowlakes the Jiinang Som people first settled. Today, the Konmawt tradition is highly refined and enjoys modest but wide-reaching respect. Ragash, who was full of undirected energy even before his transformation, is exactly the kind of Skinwalker that Konmawt guidance was designed for. He became a monk willingly, though cultural pressures would probably have made it inevitable. Warrior monks like him undertake dangerous but necessary missions against monsters, Undead, outlaws, and other threats, as both a form of devotion and also fundraising for their order, since community leaders pay well and gratefully for their heroics. The Nine-Ring Demon and the Beast of Murdgrakgor are two such threats Ragash has famously dispatched with his bog-iron steel claws, and he stands ready to uphold his duty against the forces of spiritual decay that menace Teleria.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7140#static": "The Three-Eyed Priest, the Molten-Horned Master, the High Deacon of Siroth – Hephraak bears many titles, most of them vainglorious, and with good reason. Among Firstborn Demons, few indeed are as powerful as he.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Divorce, Hephraak was one of the first of the Lightbringers to defect from Lumaya and swear allegiance to Siroth and his ideals. Such a choice raised him high in Siroth’s regard, but the God of Shadow’s favor was not without end. Initially given command of a number of Demonspawn legions after the Sin of Dragons, Hephraak’s dedication to his new master was not matched by his skills as a general or strategist. As surely as night follows day, disgrace followed on from defeat, and after the crushing losses of the battle of Redrun during the First Great War, Hephraak found himself out of favor with Siroth. He was cast down the ranks of adherents, and suffered a period of ignominy and exile.\r\n\r\nSuch a fate might have broken a less prideful Demon, but Hephraak’s self-determination was matched only by his devotion to Siroth. After capturing a Human devotee of Lumaya and binding his spirit into the unfortunate’s body, he re-entered Teleria in secret and began to spread the will of Siroth first among Humans and then beyond, not as a warrior or general, but as a darkling preacher.\r\n\r\nIt was in this role that Hephraak’s talents were fully realized. He swiftly assembled a cult around himself, feeding off its praise. Worshippers were taught the power and glory of Siroth – via his eminent servant, Hephraak, of course – and his grand intentions for Teleria. When the time was right, Hephraak led a large number through to the infernal realm of Anathraad, where they were presented as a gift to Siroth and Hephraak’s fellow Firstborn, to be consumed or used as hosts.\r\n\r\nWhile still not restoring Hephraak to his former standing, Siroth let it be known that he was pleased with his efforts. Hephraak returned to Teleria and began the long-term work of establishing not just a cult, but a true church of Siroth. The work and devotion of untold numbers of mortals, from Peltas to Anhelt to the Lost Isles, would surely be the final boon the Demonspawn needed to conquer Teleria in their dark master’s name.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, adherents of Lumaya, such as the Arbiter, quickly realized the dangerous import of Hephraak’s designs, and gave their all to stop him. Centuries passed as clashes between Hephraak’s developing cult and the followers of the Goddess of Light became embroiled in what seemed like an eternal game of cat and mouse, where neither was truly sure who was the hunter, and who the hunted. To this day, battles between Hephraak’s minions and Telerian League agents such as Inquisitors are commonplace, and the fortunes of the devotees of Siroth wax and wane as victories are won or setbacks suffered. In many places the cult’s activities are covert, with dark rites conducted secretly in cellars and catacombs in Free Cities and country hamlets. Sometimes however, where the cult is strong, it seizes control, and all who do not bow before the idols of Siroth – many of which conveniently look like Hephraak himself – find themselves next upon the sacrificial altars. Throughout it all, Hephraak himself remains one of the foremost targets to the Sacred Order, for they know that if he is banished back to the Anathraad, the cult’s devotion will suffer a crippling blow, and Siroth’s wider machinations across Teleria might be at least partially stalled, if only for a time.\r\n\r\nWhen Hephraak joins in battle, he brings all of his dark charisma to bear. The favor of the high deacon is ferociously sought by his allies and followers alike, while enemies cringe beneath the biting scorn of the ancient preacher. Though his talents are primarily in oration and radicalization, he is no easy target in the midst of battle, and his demonic strength and speed is terrible to behold when his full ire is roused.\r\n\r\nHephraak suits the role of preacher, for he adores praise and authority. He rules his adherents in a style approaching that of a demigod and, according to the claims of rival Firstborn, his cultists worship him as much as they worship Siroth. If that is the case, Siroth himself does not yet seem to have taken offense. Regardless of the exact nature of the veneration, the work of Hephraak and his minions is a valuable contribution towards the subjugation of all Teleria. Whether Hephraak will overstep himself and once again experience Siroth’s fury is uncertain, but it seems certain that, even if he does, Hephraak will set to work tirelessly once again to rebuild his power and reputation.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7190#static": "Gloomdeep Hold is a dangerous place, and no part of it more so than Port Wretched. As one of the greatest ports in all Teleria, it receives its fair share of smugglers, pirates, and ne’er-do-wells. Much of Gloomdeep’s recent success is built on the willingness to accept these sorts, and indeed any kind who are willing to pay the docking and transaction fees necessary to tie up at the port and conduct trade.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, such a place would swiftly degenerate into a state of larceny and disorder, but that reckons without the Dwarves who rule and administer Gloomdeep Hold. The law of the Mountain King as laid out in the Rights of Trade, Travel, and Redress, are absolute. Anyone visiting Gloomdeep knows that there will be no favoritism, no compromise, and no hesitation when it comes to enforcing the simple but iron-clad rulings that ensure Gloomdeep Hold continues to operate as a place of relative order and burgeoning prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo enforce these rules, Port Wretched relies on its infamous Dock Guard. Consisting of a cohort of particularly grim and stalwart Dwarven warriors, the Dock Guard are the bane of criminals, traffickers, and anyone who finds themselves even a few accidental pennies short of their ship’s full tying-up fee. Their leader is Keeyra the Watcher, a ruthless and uncompromising figure who is dreaded beyond Gloomdeep’s walls and Port Wretched's wharfs.\r\n\r\nKeeyra’s rise to the position of Watcher owes to the failure of her mother, Alanka, who herself was once Watcher, following in the footsteps of her forebears who had served in the Dock Guard. Like most Dwarves, Alanka craved wealth, and gold in particular, but hers was greater than most others. Slowly her avarice grew. As a child, Keeyra watched her mother accept bribes and turn a blind eye to lawlessness among visiting traders while she amassed a small personal fortune.\r\n\r\nBut the Dock Guard always unearths duplicity, even if it is being practiced amid its own ranks. It was Keeyra herself, once she became a junior quay inspector, who officially witnessed her mother’s corruption and immediately reported it. There was no hesitation in the dutiful dwarf, for she had always wished to be part of the Dock Guard, and believed in Gloomdeep’s laws absolutely. She was disgusted by the idea that her mother was deceiving her fellow guards and betraying the integrity of their ancestors.\r\n\r\nKeeyra brought her evidence before the Mountain King. The punishment for such a betrayal was death, but the king was impressed by Keeyra’s efforts and, taking pity on her, reduced Alanka’s sentence to banishment. But to the grumbled approval of the onlooking Dwarves, Keeyra argued for the death sentence, stating that none should be above Gloomdeep’s law and that the honor of her forbearers demanded it. The king decided not to change his sentence, but he was impressed by Keeyra’s iron will, and so promoted her to take her mother’s position. \r\n\r\nIn any other community, Keeyra's act might have seen her ostracized, but to her fellow Dwarves Keeyra's actions proved that there were few who upheld Gloomdeep’s laws, or cared about them, more than her. Alanka had failed all who had come before, and it had taken Keeyra’s intercession to save the family name and the honor of the Hold.\r\n\r\nEver since that day, the Dock Guard has been a brutal model of efficiency watched over by the scrupulous Keeyra, who ensures that nothing is allowed to interrupt the trade that is the lifeblood of Port Wretched. On the orders of the Mountain King, she is also responsible for the expansion of the Hold’s defenses, both landward and seaward, determined that one day Gloomdeep Hold will match the undeniable might of the Skyiron Dominion, whose every arriving treasure fleet seems laden down with yet more wealth.\r\n\r\nKeeyra has recently taken to leading Dock Guard expeditions abroad, hunting down those few who have broken Port Wretched’s regulations and escaped to tell the tale. Armed with Falling Star, her family’s ancient heirloom war-mace, and the mighty shield Siege Breaker, she is merciless in her punishment of those who have wronged Gloomdeep Hold. For many, she is her Hold's indomitable will made manifest, and she will not rest until every single debt has been repaid.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7200#static": "Deep within the bowels of Anathraad, there lies a place of pure darkness and chaos that is beyond even Lumaya's light. The most powerful of Demons and Demonspawn reside here. Misshapen and twisted, these beasts roam the abyssal wastes, ruling their territory from mighty citadels, in which they plot the downfall of Teleria. Among them is Helicath – a creature of unholy might, whose speed and power is matched only his malice and lust for power.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, many believe that Helicath's unnatural and jittery movements are nervous twitches, or the consequence of experiments by Siroth. Instead, each movement is a careful calculation, used by this monster to lure his enemies to their deaths and induce in them a false belief that they can easily vanquish him. Helicath is lightning-quick in both mind and body, and his enormous strength and warrior ferocity ensures that any foes who attack him only underestimate him once. It was this intellect and brutality that saw Helicath rise to be a lieutenant of Lord Shazar. In this capacity, he oversaw the creation and training of Demonspawn legions, preparing for the never-ending invasions of Teleria.\r\n\r\nFor all his bestial savagery, Helicath is patient, cunning, and ambitious. He only serves others so he can gain more power for himself. Even as he led Siroth’s legions into battle against the Arbiter and the armies of Teleria, he plotted and schemed. Above all, Helicath desired to usurp Lord Shazar so he could continue his rise through Siroth’s ranks. It would take more than a sharp knife and Helicath’s cabal to enact this betrayal, however. Killing a Firstborn Demonspawn is impossible – even for one with Helicath’s powers – as Shazar would simply be reborn. Lord Shazar could not be taken lightly, and so Helicath had to tread carefully. How could an immortal creature be defeated?\r\n\r\nEventually, word reached Helicath of a possible answer. He learned of a place where creatures languished in purgatory – a jail that spelled oblivion for all who entered it, and from where not even Demonspawn could escape. The Doom Tower. It became the centerpiece of his plans – there Lord Shazar could be imprisoned for eternity. With his rival incarcerated, Helicath’s path to the summit of Siroth’s legions would be clear. For Helicath, that is all that matters.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7210#static": "Few are as revered by the cultists of K’Leth, or as reviled by their fellow Knights Revenant, as Shemnath. Once one of the most senior of the Soul Shepherds, it was Shemnath’s duty to conduct Sacred Ceremonies of Transmission, which sees the soul of a Knight Revenant transmuted from one body to another. As the sorcerers responsible for their knight's immortality, the Soul Shepherds have always been an integral part of the Cult of K’Leth, and Shemnath’s high standing reflected her role.\r\n\r\nAll of that came to an end during one of Shemnath’s own transmissions. A new acolyte had joined the cult, a learned young woman named Mathilde. The usual promises had been made to her, and she had chosen to surrender her body freely for the use of one of the Knights Revenant. In exchange, her spirit-essence would be stored in a soul gem and, as a reward for her sacrifice, Shemnath promised that it would be one of the first to be transmuted into a new body, when one became available.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that almost no cultists received the blessing of transmission, as there were far too few suitable bodies to go round. Mathilde’s story would therefore likely have ended like that of thousands of other poor, misguided hopefuls, trapped within a soul gem callously buried beneath the earth or dropped into the sea. What Shemnath had not known, however – and what she did not discover until too late – was that Mathilde was more than she seemed. A talented sorceress in her own right, she had doubts about the sincerity of the Knights Revenant and their promises of immortality. Before surrendering her body to act as Shemnath’s vessel, she placed a secret curse upon it. As long as Mathilde’s soul lingered within a soul gem, and was not granted a new body, her old form – the one now belonging to Shemnath – would slowly turn to stone.\r\n\r\nShemnath did not discover the trickery until some years after she had inhabited Mathilde’s body. The easiest resolution would have been to destroy Mathilde’s soul gem but, like many Knights Revenant, Shemnath had discarded it once the ritual was completed, and could not find it. She bent all of her substantial sorcerous talents to ending the curse and curing her new form of its stony disfigurement, but found she could only slow the process, not halt it. She decided that the gem had to be relocated or, even better, completely destroyed, wiping out Mathilde’s essence.\r\n\r\nConvinced, perhaps by her own pride, that the gem had in fact been stolen rather than simply lost, Shemnath embarked upon a quest for Mathilde’s imprisoned essence, a quest she still pursues to this day. As long as the gem exists, and Mathilde’s soul remains within it rather than in a new body, Shemnath’s limbs become ever-more stiff and her skin even harder and craggier.\r\n\r\nShemnath’s mistake in transferring herself into Mathilde’s body without detecting the curse upon it cost her the position of Soul Shepherd. Once a senior Knight Revenant, she is now scorned by the others following her fall from grace, and she seeks a return to her former high standing as desperately as she seeks Mathilde’s essence. Ironically however, her condition has made her a figure of even greater reverence among the common acolytes of the Cult of K’Leth. Blind to the realities of the soul gems, they call her the Mother Caryatid and the Eternal Soul Shepherd, believing her condition is due to the fact that she has been chosen to eternally oversee the passage of old souls into bodies anew. Disabusing the acolytes of such a notion would risk revealing the true nature of the cult, the other Knights Revenant have little choice other than to humor these beliefs. For her own part, Shemnath cares little one way or another – for the time being, all that matters is finding the soul gem and ending her curse.\r\n\r\nShemnath’s quest often sees her locked in mortal combat, and in such a state her supposed curse becomes more of a blessing. Swords and axes break and shatter against her stony form, while she breaks apart shield and armor alike with her Soul Shepherd staff, or uses it to call down necromantic destruction on those standing in her way. Her determination is as unyielding as her graven form, and when she finally destroys Mathilde and brings the curse to an end, as she is sure she will, she has every intention of reclaiming her former role within the Cult of K’Leth. On that day there will be a reckoning with all Knights Revenant who have refused to stand by her over the years, a reckoning that many will not survive.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7220#static": "As the Castellan of Narbuk, it was Artorax’s duty to guard the tunnels that radiated from the Cult of K’Leth’s headquarters, those catacombs and crypts that extended like an ant warren beneath the ruins of the city. Assuming this station to be a safe and unchallenging one, Artorax had campaigned to secure it for himself and was proud of his grand new title. But all too quickly he tired of his work. The monotony of patrolling crumbling corridors and watching over musty tombs became unbearable and he longed to escape, but he knew that if he failed at his duties, he would be expelled from the cult and lose his chance for immortality.\r\n\r\nSpending his every moment with the dead sent Artorax’s mind spinning, and he began to think of a way to escape his lot. Necromancers sometimes visited the tombs, and Artorax sought out one of the most skilled, offering her wealth he did not own in exchange for her services. Together they gathered body parts from the crypt and using the dark magics of soul gems to subvert the ritual of soul transmission, they set about conjuring a creature to take Artorax’s place. The result was a golem – a large, sewn-together corpse which took its life force from the fraction of Artorax’s essence that he and the necromancer had buried within it.\r\n\r\nWhen the creature came to life and Artorax’s soul was wrenched apart, Artorax screamed with agony, but his yearning for freedom was great and he held fast as the grotesque creature rose. The golem was crude and lumbering but it knew its purpose and obeyed Artorax’s commands. Elated at his apparent success, Artorax departed Narbuk, leaving the creature to patrol the depths in his stead. He called his creation, the Walking Tomb Dreng. \r\n\r\nYears passed and Artorax reveled in his new life of freedom. But his sleep was haunted by visions of the tombs and tunnels of Narbuk, and he found himself perpetually cold, unable to warm himself with the heat of fire. There was no denying that his necromancy had not set him free at all, and he could still feel within him the part of his soul that still wandered the chilly catacombs. Castellan of Narbuk was his title, and Castellan of Narburk he still remained.\r\n\r\nArtorax knew he must return to Narbuk to reclaim his soul fragment. He waited many long nights before finding a necromancer who reluctantly agreed to attempt a ritual to reclaim Artorax’s soul. But the magic they produced was not great enough to overthrow the physical might of the Walking Tomb Dreng. As the sorcerer fled, the Walking Tomb Dreng muzzled Artorax in a hood of iron akin to that it wore. Sensing the other part of its soul was close, the creature craved to be whole again. It strapped the struggling Knight Revenant to an ancient, elaborate chair and affixed it to its back, then, finally content, the Tomb Dreng resumed its walking.\r\n\r\nThose few desperate souls who have reason to travel into Narbuk without the Cult of K’Leth’s consent tell dreadful tales of muffled, despairing screams, accompanied by the slow thumping of heavy footfalls, the scrape of armor against stone, and the flicker of flame. Artorax’s horror at his imprisonment rings through the catacombs he was once custodian of, but his struggles are in vain, for his mind and soul remain fused with the dead thing he created. It pursues intruders relentlessly through the maze of cobwebbed chambers and dank, narrow passageways, until it finds its mark with the great, flaming swords it carries.\r\n\r\nKnights Revenant talk of Artorax’s fate with wariness, for his has become a cautionary tale within the cult, eternal proof that none but the Soul Shepherds should dare meddle with the magics of the soul gems or the rituals of transmutation. On occasion the Walking Tomb Dreng will be persuaded to come forth and do battle alongside other Knights Revenant, or even other forces, while Artorax’s howls for assistance from his former allies go unheeded. At battle’s close, however, the Walking Tomb Dreng always returns to Narbuk’s frozen darkness and the duties for which it was created – to guard the cult’s secrets for eternity.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7230#static": "Arix was once a knight of the Sacred Order. Young and idealistic, she combined her vigor and fighting skills with an unswerving dedication to the tenets of her faith. She rose quickly through the ranks, but always hungered for greater success, greater glory. She harbored a zealous hatred of the Undead, and sought assignments to hunt them throughout Anhelt and beyond.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before Arix’s fervor saw her overreach. After being promised reinforcements by a senior knight of the Sacred Order, she set out to slay a necromancer by the name of Arkuaz. Her warriors were few, and when she cornered Arkuaz, the expected aid failed to materialize. Arix’s companions fell to Arkuaz’s Undead host. Arix herself barely escaped. When she sought out the knight who’d promised to help her, she discovered that he’d been killed in a battle against another Undead foe.\r\n\r\nArix now saw that the forces of the Order were not powerful enough to protect Teleria from the curse of Siroth’s spawn. Many had the advantage of immortality while the warriors of the Order were mere mortals. Arix resolved to find a way to change things: to find the time and strength she needed to tip the scales in the everlasting crusade against the Undead. It was at this point that she crossed paths with the Cult of K’Leth.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Cult of K’Leth showed Arix how, if she proved her worth, her soul could be transmuted – via a soul gem – into a younger body. At first, Arix was suspicious of the dark magics involved, but she was also desperate, and believed her purity of purpose would protect her. After all, she did not seek such immortality for personal power, but so she could make herself an unrelenting enemy of the Undead.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Arix was inducted into the Cult of K’Leth, and fell prey to its pervasive teachings. The leaders of the cult, the Knights Revenant, did indeed have their consciousness transferred, to younger, more able bodies, but they had little desire to share such a privilege with the thousands of acolytes who made up their body of servants. Occasionally, however, one would catch their eye.\r\n\r\nArix was one such fortunate. Her sword-skill was impressive, and her presence within the Sacred Order made her a useful asset. She was courted by one particular Knight Revenant, Zoriel, who tried to use her to influence the Order. Over the years, Arix became ever more warped by the beliefs of the cult, yearning for immortality and losing sight of her former good intent. It angered her to see how the likes of Zoriel were not willing to share their immortality. Eventually, Arix challenged Zoriel, demanding that she be given a new, younger body, or she would not only slay Zoriel, but shatter his soul gem too, snuffing out his existence forever.\r\n\r\nArix defeated Zoriel, and the desperate Knight Revenant granted Arix's wish. Believing she would need to choose the body of someone pure if her own supposedly righteous purpose was to remain unsullied, Arix abducted a squire from the Sacred Order to be her vessel. Once a knight of the Sacred Order, Arix’s soul was now twisted by decades spent with the Cult of K’Leth. Now the dark magics of this rushed ceremony took from her the only good that was left.\r\n\r\nWhat Arix had done soon became known to the Order, and she was not only expelled, but declared Undead. When Arix’s former friends came for her, they found her much changed. Finding their zealotry small-minded, Arix slayed them all, deciding that it was the Sacred Order which was in fact misguided. If they could not see that only an immortal could match the Undead, then she would not count herself among their number.\r\n\r\nIn the decades since, Arix’s hatred of the Undead has remained, but her path has long since wandered. She will ally with the Sacred Order, albeit grudgingly, but any amity she once had to it has long ago withered and died. The Knights Revenant now see Arix as an outlier and a danger: to them she is unwelcome proof that despicable, disposable acolytes are not beyond seizing a power of their own. For her own part, Arix cares nothing for her former fellow-cultists. She rose to her current position through her iron will and skill, and any incapable of doing so themselves are not worthy of her assistance. Arix claimed immortality with sword and fist, and she will keep it the same way, whether her fellow Knights Revenant approve or not.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7240#static": "Born to a warrior Nomad clan of the Krokhan Desert, whose only values were weapon skills and a tendency for violence, no loving arm was placed around Crohnam as a child. Instead, he was tortured by his own kin – they intended to make a merciless killer of him. Receiving no compassion in his youth, he would give none in return, and give none in his adulthood. He was beaten daily, made to carry heavy weights up and down dunes, and forced to wrestle older, stronger boys. Though it was a way of life that broke many of his peers, Crohnam thrived. He believed wholeheartedly in the ways of his people. He felt his mind and body harden, and he loved the strength and power it imbued in him.\r\n\r\nBy the age of twelve, Crohnam regularly fought and defeat rivals and enemies much greater in size than him. So firm was his confidence that he challenged a clan leader to a battle to the death. Believing this to be little more than the fanciful thinking of an arrogant child, the clan leader accepted. He soon found himself battling for his life against his challenger, who was far more powerful than his slight frame suggested. Crohnam was defeated, but not before he had broken his opponent's nose and several of his fingers. Though it had been a fight to the death, Crohnam’s life was spared when the other clan leaders stepped in. He had been defeated, but the leaders saw that Crohnam was a mighty warrior who could be of great use. To kill him was deemed a terrible waste.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, Crohnam’s face came to bear the scars of his duty. Each scar had a tale to tell, none more so than the one on his cheek that he received when traveling to assassinate the leader of an enemy clan. As he entered the enemy’s territory, he was ambushed by a pack of Sandlashed Orcs in a rocky ravine. The battle was long and draining, and with every passing minute Crohnam could feel the strength in his arms fade. Despite this, the bodies of dead Orcs were piling up around him, and he knew that he could win. He had just hacked down another Orc with an ax when he felt a blade pierce his cheek, followed by a ferocious burning where he had been struck. An Orc bearing a pair of blades that radiated white heat had flanked him, but the creature's stab was shallow. It was a mistake that cost it its life. Ignoring the hideous pain, Crohnam spun around, drove an ax into his assailant's right knee and as she collapsed drove his other ax into her neck. Soon after, the few remaining Orcs fled. Crohnam took the fiery blades as a prize. When he held them he marveled at the power that surged through his body. His felt reinvigorated.\r\n\r\nWith a hole in his cheek, and many other smaller wounds across his body, Crohnam continued his mission. He sneaked into the enemy camp, drove his new blades into the chest of his quarry and slipped away into the night. Within days of his victory, his clan doubled its territory, securing the Londalah Oasis and Kontor Hill, a vital water source and high ground.\r\n\r\nThe wound on Crohnam's cheek eventually healed, but his blades' magic meant that where the flesh re-knit the scar resembled a narrow stream of magma. It stings Crohnam to this very day, but he knows full well that pain breeds strength. Decades have since passed. Crohnam's might has never been greater, his blades, now called Death's Furies, have never been sharper, and his clan's territory has never been larger. He challenged the old clan leader again, and won, and no contender has dared try to oust him from his command. To do so would be folly. None believe they can best him, and none believe they could lead the clan better. He has maintained all the brutal traditions that made him and his people strong, despite the increasing wealth and prosperity of his clan that could so easily have made it weak.\r\n\r\nAlthough harsh and uncompromising, Crohnam is swift to reward what he sees as true loyalty, courage, and strength, and so is loved by his warriors and people. He makes them rich, and he keeps them feared.  Would-be challengers are also terrified of Crohnam's chief advisor, the oracle-shaman Djamarsa. An individual of fell power and ambiguous words, she is always sat at his side in rituals and gatherings. What none know besides Crohnam is that she has foreseen his doom, and is the only one who can protect him from it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7250#static": "There are few names that strike fear into the hearts of the sailors and seafarers of Teleria as much as Goffred Brassclad. Some claim that the Dwarf and the mighty warship that bears his name are both nothing more than maritime legends, tall tales invented or, at the very least, exaggerated by sailors looking to spin a yarn good enough to earn themselves a free round of tavern grog. The wiser ones don’t repeat the stories, for they know that they are not really stories at all, but accounts pointing to the existence of the one of the most implacable and unyielding warriors to ever take to the high seas.\r\n\r\nGoffred was born with sea salt in his blood. There remains no greater naval power in all of Teleria than the grand fleet of the Dwarf kingdom of the Skyiron Dominion, and as the son of one of Skyiron's admirals, Goffred was more accustomed to the quarterdeck than he was the mountain slopes of the cantons or the forges buried beneath the rocks. He had every intention of following his father in nautical service to the Dominion, but when that day came, it was sooner than Goffred would have liked.\r\n\r\nNot long after he had come of age, the youthful Goffred was acting as a petty officer on the frigate Fyrstone. Along with other war vessels under his father’s command, the ship was assigned to guard one of the fabled Dwarf treasure fleets as it traversed the seas between the Dominion and Gloomdeep Hold. Such a duty was always fraught with peril, for while the Skyiron Navy provided the greatest of protection, there was no prize more alluring than a Dwarf ship with a hold laden down with gold and silver.\r\n\r\nOn this particular voyage, temptation proved too much for a Gaellen pirate fleet hailing from the Sorrowlakes. It struck at the Dwarven convoy as it made its return journey to the Dominion. Unwilling to lose even a single ship, Goffred’s father signaled to the other vessels to hold their course as he turned his own to keep the Gaellen forces at bay. Goffred begged the captain of the Fyrstone to turn and aid his father, but orders were orders. All he could do was watch as the flagship sank beneath the waves after a long, brutal battle, taking his beloved father with it.\r\n\r\nAs strong as an ocean’s swell, cold fury gripped Goffred. When he made it back to the Dominion he made every effort to convince the kingdom’s moot that greater investment was needed in order to protect the treasure fleets. He also spent his inheritance on commissioning one of the greatest warships that would ever sail with the Skyiron Navy. He named it Brassclad, sheeting its flanks in the metal that now shielded his own soul, and rendering it impervious to almost any stone or bolt launched by an enemy ship.\r\n\r\nIn a thinly-veiled quest for vengeance, Goffred set out to lure the Gaellen pirates responsible for his father’s death into attacking another treasure fleet, hiding Brassclad in a cove as the apparently lightly-protected convoy passed the place his father's ships had been attacked. The Gaellens took the bait, and swiftly regretted it. Brassclad was unstoppable, a floating metal mountain that spat great arcs of charge from the lightning launchers that bristled along its sides, igniting sails, blasting apart timber, and making steel and iron run molten. By the end of the engagement, the Gaellen fleet had been reduced to burning hulks floating around the Brassclad’s unyielding bulk.\r\n\r\nEver since that day, Goffred has overseen the safe passage of the treasure fleets. Irascible and uncompromising, he is now as battle-scarred and hardened as the gouged brass flanks of his flagship, and just as at home a part of boarding parties or shore expeditions as he is giving commands from beside the capstan. Those few who manage to steal any of the gold the fleets carry will find themselves hunted the length and breadth of Teleria, whether on land or sea. The hammer and mace Brassclad wields can shatter bulkheads as easily as they do shields, and his own chain-clad armor deflects the blows of the enemy as surely as his ship’s metal skin can.\r\n\r\nThe crews of the treasure fleets rest easy in their berths knowing that the mighty Brassclad watches over their vessels. There is a good reason why only the desperate or the foolhardy attempt to steal riches from the Dwarf treasure convoys now – to do so, they would have to get past Goffred, and then survive his pursuit. There are none more relentless, on either sea or land, than Brassclad.",

From the prophetic Spiritwalkers to the dreaded Skytouched Shamans, there are all manner of sects, cults, and belief systems that flourish in the desert’s scorching heat. Some are more attuned to the freezing hours of darkness. None of these believers are as powerful and mysterious as Djamarsa, Daughter of the Moon, Servant of the All-Seeing Eye.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Djamarsa was separated from her clan during its seasonal migration and nearly perished. Lost amid shifting sands, she wandered until night fell, and the moon rose over the desert, full and bright. In desperation, she prayed to the silvery orb, seeing its silvery brilliance as a symbol of Lumaya’s divinity. Perhaps there is truth to that, for aid did come to Djamarsa. She was found and rescued by an old woman, a seer of the night, who took her in and began teaching her.\r\n\r\nDjamarsa progressed quickly, mastering the arts of prophecy by harnessing the hours of darkness and moonlight. When she foresaw the death of her teacher, the older seer announced her student's learning to be complete. She passed her two most precious relics to Djamarsa – the All-Seeing Eye and the Moonlight Fragment, and told her that the latter was a piece of the moon that she herself had seen plunge into the heart of the desert.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Djamarsa plied a difficult trade as an oracle-shaman among the clans. Moon-magic and night-worship are rare in the Krokhan, and she soon acquired a reputation as a harbinger of doom. While some were eager to hear her wisdom, others saw her as a servant of evil, and sought to end her prophesying forever.\r\n\r\nDjamarsa had foreseen their efforts and awaited her attackers. As they surrounded her and drew their blades, a shout came from nearby. Unbeknownst to them, Djamarsa had led them close to the camp of Crohnam, the chieftain of a local clan. He stumbled across the would-be murder scene and demanded Djamarsa be freed, insisting that no one was killed in his territory without his say-so. When her assailants refused and attacked him, he drew his burning blades and cut them down. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Crohnam and told him many things, of past and future both. Crohnam, though a scarred and brutal warlord, was impressed by Djamarsa, and asked if she would stay and act as his oracle and advisor. She accepted, for she had already foreseen his request.\r\n\r\nSince then, Djamarsa has rarely left Crohnam’s side. As well giving him prophecies and wise counsel, she is a powerful ally in battle. She can heal with the power of the moon’s rays and lull enemies to sleep with the magic of the night. Still, all of her darkling abilities may not be enough to help Crohnam to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nDjamarsa has foreseen Crohnam’s future, a fact that the clan warlord is aware of, though he has never questioned Djamarsa about it – he knows she would not tell him, as to do so would risk upsetting the delicate balance of fate, and his respect for her is too great to ask such a thing. This is well, for Djamarsa has foreseen Crohnam’s death in battle, a sacrifice made to save his people. Such a vision pains her more than any she has known, yet still she holds out a lingering hope that it might somehow be averted, even if others must pay the price.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7300#static": "Skeuramis was born a commoner and became a hero, upon a stage of high drama in the history of Teleria. In the Age of Hellfire Siroth launched his Second Great War, invading the world with both Demonspawn and a horde of Undead that he had secretly assembled in his dark realm of Anathraad. In response, the Arbiter sent forth a sacred clarion call, and across the world the mortal races set aside their differences to heed it. They had weathered the storms of Darkness for generation after generation, and when they raged their hardest, Telerians stood united. \r\n\r\nSkeuramis the Elf stood beside hulking Ogryn, war-painted Orcs, sharp-clawed Lizardmen, and ranks of Humans, all mustering before holy battle-altars of the Sacred Order, girding themselves for war. It was a scene of multicultural magnificence unlike any other. Lords and ladies stood beside their peasants as nigh-equals, for each one knew that the devouring Darkness would see no difference between noble and commoner, should they fail. And all the mortals who had gathered to defend Teleria were awed and humbled by the Arbiter herself when she visited each site and host in turn to bestow her grace, even but briefly. Her words echoed in the hearts and minds of everyone. \r\n\r\nWhen the armies of Darkness fell upon he and his fellow warriors, Skeuramis felt the Arbiter’s blessing surge like righteous fire within him, and though he was but a humble craftsman who had undergone hasty training at arms, that blessing guided his limbs and steeled his courage and he fought as though he had trained for decades. In his first clash he wielded a simple, mass-produced spear, and mastered it. After several battles he was awarded a fine greatsword, plunder from a clash with the Undead, and though it was an unwieldy and exotic blade he intuitively understood how to wield its weight and momentum. The Arbiter’s grace was strong upon him indeed, and though an Elf of few words, others looked to him as an anchor in the heat of battle.  \r\n\r\nFor year after year the war raged on, and Skeuramis proved himself time and again. Near the end of the war the carnage peaked, and Skeuramis fought his most famous battle. A massive, hulking Demonspawn had come, dealing death with a blazing whip, and bearing chains of otherworldly metal that tethered four slavering Undead hounds. Even when the rank and file skeletons and Demonspawn were swept away by the Arbiter’s forces, this frightful behemoth and its hounds remained, killing all who approached. Skeuramis charged the Demonspawn brute, and those around him followed. \r\n\r\nThe Fellhounds leapt at Skeuramis and his cohort, and they say he severed all four chains with his first stroke, and split all four Undead beasts in twain with his second. The Demonspawn bellowed its rage, and lashed out with its fire-whip as well as the four whirling chains, and several of Skeuramis’ comrades were struck down. But the Elf did not falter and closed the gap, and at close range the whip-wielding Demonspawn could not parry Skeuramis’ blows. The Elf severed the creature’s limbs and ran it through the chest. But the vile being, with one last act of violence, bit Skeuramis in the neck, ripping through his helmet and armor and spilling his lifeblood. \r\n\r\nAs the forces of Light won the day and took control of the battlefield, Skeuramis lay bleeding to death, but he did not perish. The Arbiter had witnessed his valor, and offered him life eternal within a Shard, which Skeuramis accepted gratefully.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7330#static": "The woodland east of the fallen city of Narbuk is cursed, on that all who know of it agree – all but the villagers who live near it, that is. \r\n\r\nAccording to oral tradition, the hills that overlook the winding Wispernbrook River were once dotted with farmsteads and villages. The waters of the river, besides an abundance of fish, gave good crop yields and watered a multitude of grazers, providing for the hardy country folk of the region. Life there had followed the turning of the seasons for many generations, largely undisturbed, until crusaders of Lumaya came.\r\n\r\nThe target of their ire was a wise woman known only as Morrigaine. No one knew quite where she had come from, but the local farmers knew that she lived in the thick, tangled woodlands just beyond the Wispernbrook’s eastern bank. She lived alone, but was happy enough to welcome people brave enough to seek her out. To those in need, she gave her assistance – a cure for a lingering sickness, a poultice for an oozing wound, a palm-reading, or a simple phrase to recite to purge a crop of blight. In exchange she asked for little. Sometimes food, or herbs. On other occasions she would ask for a lock of hair or old wisdom teeth. \r\n\r\nFew of the villagers noted how long Morrigaine had lived on the borders of their communities. Despite her aid, their lives were hard and short, and their daily toils kept them from pondering such matters too deeply. Most were just happy with her assistance. Certainly, none questioned when Morrigaine’s payments started to grow more outlandish, for they were still so small when weighed against the support she provided. A drop of blood, a teardrop, a child’s first toy, all of these things were still easily given. And of course, when the disappearances started, the people sought Morrigaine’s help and advice, rather than blamed her. Alas, no trace of any of those who vanished could ever be found, but then that was not in itself outlandish. The Wispernbrook ran quick, and all knew that the hilltops were not safe at night, with wolves and worse on the prowl. \r\n\r\nMatters came to a head during the Age of Treachery when a band of Sacred Order warriors came. They passed through, stopping at one of the Wispernbrook hamlets for food and ale. Their leader admitted they were on the hunt, seeking out a dangerous necromancer who had escaped the destruction of Narbuk and the slaughter that had been wreaked upon the dark sorcerers there. \r\n\r\nWithout warning, the villagers rose up against the Sacred Order warriors, setting about their erstwhile guests with knives, scythes, pitchforks, and mallets. Caught completely by surprise, a number of the crusaders were slain, but they swiftly rallied. Peasants were no match for the armed and armored warriors of blessed Lumaya, and the crusaders swiftly triumphed. They pressed on into the woodlands beyond the Wispernbrook and, after a ferocious hunt, finally tracked down and cornered Morrigaine.\r\n\r\nThe trial that followed was a short one. Morrigaine was accused of witchcraft and necromancy, of having bedeviled the peoples of the Wispernbrook. Mockingly, she pled guilty. The crusaders bound her in heavy chains, and ceremonially cast her into the cold, rushing waters of the dark river. \r\n\r\nMorrigaine’s tale may have ended there, were it not for one oversight – the crusaders had not succeeded in slaying all the villagers under her thrall. Once they had departed, the survivors of the massacre returned, and were able to unshackle the witch’s body from the riverbed. Freed from the damnable bonds, Morrigaine rose up, more terrible, more beautiful, and more powerful than ever before. \r\n\r\nThere are still farmers living along the Wispernbrook, a small band of hardy folk. They don’t take kindly to outsiders and, when asked, say little of the neighboring forest, or the deathly lights that can sometimes be glimpsed through the trees. Those traveling through that bitter region are well advised to bear sacred tokens of Lumaya on them at all times, to spend each night with a firmly bolted door between themselves and the darkness, and to not heed the mournful cries that are sometimes carried on the wild wind. If they do not, they too may soon find themselves in the thrall of the Witch of the Wispernbrook.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7340#static": "Many Fae regard the Lord of the Faunas, Ailil, to be one the greatest protectors of the Mistwood’s animals and believe him to be a gift given by the forest itself to guard its children. \r\n\r\nBefore Siroth’s corruption of the great forest, this silent recluse rarely interacted with other Sylvan, and spent his time tending to the forest’s myriad animals. With his scythe, he swung from tree to tree, cropped the environment to suit the animals’ needs, and protected creatures from harm. \r\n\r\nFor the longest time, the Sylvan considered Ailil a shepherding spirit and left offerings of flower wreaths and whittled tokens by lichen-stripped trees and nests to guide him to vulnerable animals, so that he might include them in his herd. Little did they know, this well-intentioned act angered Ailil, for he knew of all the wood’s animals, could hear their cries, and felt their hearts as his own, and feared the motivations behind the Sylvan who felt the need to mark them out.\r\n\r\nSo it was that Ailil came to lurk in the treetops, ready to ambush any who came to ‘litter’ his forest. The unfortunate soul he first descended upon was a young Elven girl who had come to the den of a mother boar with chains of bluebells and violets.\r\n\r\nIn a voice older than oak, Ailil demanded to know why the girl sought to disturb the boar’s home, especially while the beast had young to shelter. Shocked that he spoke her tongue, the girl dropped to her knees and begged Ailil for aid. The boar had been injured, and the girl had intended to leave the flowers as a request for Ailil to watch over the piglets. Though Ailil had already resolved the matter, so moved was he that another cared for the animals that he asked if all the Sylvan trinkets he had found had been left for similar purposes. Once the girl explained her people’s beliefs, Ailil returned the offerings and reassured her that she need not worry – lost fawns, birds with broken wings, and all other creatures in pain were being cared for. The girl spread the word and so it was that the Sylvan learned of Ailil’s name and dubbed him Lord of the Faunas.\r\n\r\nStill, Ailil did not frequent the Sylvan beyond what was required for his animals’ needs, and the Sylvan learned that he needed no assistance in maintaining the creatures’ wellbeing. That was until the great Darkness descended upon the Mistwood and tampered with the Sylvans’ sacred guide, the Rhythm that connected all things of the Mistwood.\r\n\r\nThough the Lord of the Faunas escaped the spreading corruption, his link to his animals was severed. He could no longer hear them, though he felt their pain like an implacable thorn in his skin. While the Sylvan Watchers fought evil’s spread, the homemakers and foresters of the land once again hung offerings on branches to signpost Ailil’s way to frightened or wounded animals. But too often he found the hunted creatures too late. Servants of evil skinned foxes for their pelts, butchered deer and rabbits to feast upon their flesh, and burned the trees that housed countless flocks and fledglings.\r\n\r\nEnraged, Ailil took up his scythe and hunted the beings that pleasured in tormenting innocent creatures, and rained down his wrath upon them. Day and night, the Lord of the Faunas leapt through the trees in search of his prey and sliced through them as they had the wolves, boars, and countless others. But no matter how tireless his efforts, it was not enough to stop the enemy.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Ailil reluctantly joined the Sylvan Watchers. So long as they shared his love for the forest and were willing to risk their lives to protect it, he accepted that his goals aligned with theirs and realized that his odds of success were greater within a united army. The Watchers offered him the blades of their work and Ailil became one of the most formidable in their ranks. With unmatched raw strength, he slew in the hundreds, slicing his foes apart with his scythe, as sharp as a chill autumn wind, but he was not as indiscriminate as some of his fellows. If some foe proved themselves a friend to beasts, Ailil stayed his blades from their flesh with little regard for orders or the greater good.\r\n\r\nAs it is clear where his loyalties lie, Ailil has become a point of contention among the Sylvan Watchers. Some find that his disinterest in the Sylvan folk makes it hard to cooperate with him, while others consider his integrity admirable. Regardless, there is no doubt that his quiet fury is a vital weapon in the war against evil, and so long as the creatures of the Mistwood suffer, the Lord of the Faunas will fight.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7350#static": "When the Mikage Autocracy rose to power in Yakai, its mortal leaders made no secret of their allegiance to Siroth. Most worshipped him as the prime deity of their new kingdom, but some went a step further. They sought out the Shadow God himself, and gave him their souls to become Demonspawn.  \r\n\r\nThe warrior known as Michinaki was one such wretch. A skilled and deadly leader of the Mikage Autocracy’s armies, he showed no hesitation when confronted with the offer of Demonhood. He gave his soul and his freedom to Siroth, not then imagining that an altogether different form of imprisonment awaited him.\r\n\r\nMichinaki led the Autocracy’s foremost army, the Legion of the Horned Skull, against the rebellion growing in Yakai. Many were his victories, and many were the traitors his forces slaughtered in battle or in the pursuits that followed, or nailed to posts on the side of roadways as a warning to others who would dare defy the Mikage.  \r\n\r\nStill, however, the tide of the war turned slowly and irrevocably against the servants of Siroth. The Legion of the Horned Skull's victories became ever-more pyrrhic, and the strength of the rebels grew as they learned how to fight the Mikage’s armies.  \r\n\r\nEventually, perhaps inevitably, Michinaki suffered defeat. A rebel force led by a Dawnlands sorcerer known as Tymo succeeded in ambushing the Legion of the Horned Skull. All of Michinaki’s warriors were cut down in the bloodbath that followed, and Michinaki had every intention sharing their fate and being sent to Anathraad as a result. Tymo, however, had other ideas.\r\n\r\nKnowing that holding one of the Mikage’s foremost commanders prisoner would be a powerful sign of how far the rebellion had come, Tymo had Michinaki bound in physical and magical irons and fetters, which contained his physical strength and arcane power. The sorcerer, however, had been jaded by the long war, and decided that captivity was too good for a monster such as Michinaki. He unleashed the full wrath of his sorcerous power on him, torturing him as assuredly as Siroth tortured those who displeased him. The green fires that he summoned burned Michinaki’s flesh from his warped bone and twisted him into an even more horrifying visage of pain and suffering. The arcane flames, born out of dark magic, burned Michinaki night and day, and his shrieks of pain echoed through the rebel encampment he was held in. He swore bloody vengeance on Tymo, but the sorcerer laughed in his face. At last, it was the Mikage who suffered, and not the common folk of Yakai. \r\n\r\nMichinaki’s torture may have continued indefinitely, had not a gentler soul intervened. Fearing that Tymo’s actions had passed from being justified into excessive, the sorcerer’s apprentice waited until the rest of the camp was asleep, then undid Michinaki’s bonds. Surely the broken, smoldering creature had learned his error, and was now no threat to anyone?  \r\n\r\nThe opposite was true. As soon as the shackles were undone, Michinaki’s power was unconstrained. He snapped the apprentice's neck and retrieved his sword, before hacking a path through rebel soldiers to Tymo’s tent. Tymo unleashed his magical fires at Michinaki, but found they no longer hurt the Demonspawn. The flames, always rooted in dark magic, betrayed Tymo, instead obeying Michinaki as their new master and enveloped him without causing harm. The Demonspawn had passed through the inferno, and emerged stronger. Michinaki beheaded Tymo, bound the severed head in the chains that had once held him, and set it aflame with his new powers.\r\n\r\nAfter he defeated Tymo, Michinaki fought his way from the camp and disappeared. Soon after, the Mikage Autocracy fell, but the campaigns of one of its greatest generals were not over. Michinaki was filled with the need for revenge. Even more than before, he became known as a dire, cursed warrior, and he continued to hunt down and slay those who had defied the Mikage. Throughout it all, the Demonspawn carried the head of Tymo. Its silent, agonized expression showed that the sorcerer was somehow still conscious, forced to experience the pain he once wreaked upon Michinaki, and incapable of doing anything but watch the Demonspawn wage war upon the people of Yakai and their Dwarven and Sylvan allies.\r\n\r\nRumor has it that Michinaki no longer acts alone. Much in the same way that the rebels of Yakai slowly gathered their strength before striking, so it is now claimed that Michinaki draws the cursed and the dispossessed to him, forming a corrupt force of Demonspawn and mortal Mikage loyalists to rival his lost Legion of the Horned Skull. If such tales are true, more than just Yakai should tremble in fear.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7360#static": "A true legend of Velyzar’s famous arenas, Ronda was destined for martial mastery from early life. Born to a minor Banner Lord house in Kaerok with lands bordering the dangerous Durham Forest, great things were expected of her, and before she had even learned to read or write, Ronda began her training in the art of war, sparring alongside her seven brothers. Lavish banquets and lessons in high society had no place in Ronda’s life – hers was to be an endless proving ground, training alongside the other warriors of her father's house.\r\n\r\nThe first glimpse into Ronda's true potential came, when at fifteen, she persuaded her father to let her compete in one of his tournaments. Despite being disarmed during a melee, Ronda defeated four knights and news of her triumph spread quickly throughout Kaerok. Soon after, Ronda entered the service of a local baron, acting as her lord's protector, champion, and a settler of disputes. Tales spread far and wide of Ronda’s victories, and patrons from Kaerok and beyond flooded her baron’s court to catch a glimpse of this mighty fighter. \r\n\r\nSo formidable was Ronda’s reputation that the king of Kaerok himself employed her as his champion, and as the years passed, her fame and fortune blossomed. It wasn’t long before fighting for others bored Ronda, however. With nobody left in Kaerok to truly test her, there was only one path remaining that appeared open to her. Arrayed in golden armor and with a sash of her house's colors girt about her waist, Ronda ventured to the Arena City of Velyzar. There, she quickly rose through the ranks to become a living legend among the city's countless gladiators. Ronda fought with her bare hands, overwhelming opponents by exploiting their weaknesses, choking them into submission, and wearing them down with her unrivaled stamina. Whether she fought monstrous Demonspawn, stout Dwarves, or lithe Elven sorcerers, no adversary was beyond her. After years of climbing through the rankings, she was crowned the Queen of the Arena, earning herself the coveted Belt of Victory. \r\n\r\nSuch achievements alone were not enough for Ronda, who endlessly sought new mountains to climb, and new enemies to conquer. Leaving Velyzar, Ronda began a pilgrimage, hunting down greater and greater foes. Tales of Ronda's wanderings vary depending on the teller, but it is claimed that Ronda once killed a dragon with her bare hands, that she destroyed a giant knight of pure flame with a single punch, and has even held Siroth himself by the throat. What is true is that, far and wide, people hail her as a savior from brutes and monsters.\r\n\r\nWhile the tales are hazy, Ronda’s greatness is beyond all doubt. Word of her exploits even reached the ears of the Arbiter herself, who asked for her aid. For Ronda, there was no greater honor than to become a Champion of the Arbiter, which she continues to be, fighting not for glory or fame, but for the protection of all Teleria from the horrors that threaten it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7370#static": "None can say for certain how old Elva Autumnborn is, nor confirm from what point in her existence she could be considered a living being. To some, she was born the moment her ethereal essence danced among falling leaves. To most Sylvan, the day she formed a sentience beyond the Rhythm, and first conducted the dances of the leaves and chose where and when they fell is the time of her birth.\r\n\r\nMost commonly, storytellers open the tale of Elva’s long life speaking of a day a family of Fae foragers heard her wailing winds in the branches and found her spirit mourning a tree that had withered and shed its leaves too soon. Feeling her grief as their own, these Fae gathered the once verdant leaves and scattered them in twisting patterns around the roots of the dying tree. With their magic, they breathed a new bloom into the tree so that its leaves could once again be the dancers to Elva's song. From then on, Elva accompanied the foragers. \r\n\r\nElva’s form changed frequently in those early days. Once an evanescent wisp on the wind, she appeared in plants, using vines and twigs to mimic the faces of those in her company. When words were not enough to help them, she sprouted limbs from branches to better assist the family in their tasks. She taught them how to sing to the flora of the Mistwood, and they taught her how to revive those who had grown too tired or frail to dance. Eventually, her form settled into the shape of a woman with leaf-green skin wrapped in garments of flowers and vines. It was around this time of physical settling that she named the family of foragers as her kin.\r\n\r\nThis family welcomed Elva into their village and their elders began training her in earnest how to mend what was broken and how to heal the sick. Once her talent exceeded the elders’, they took her to the great tree-city of Nyresa. Elva's power over the falling leaves found her a place in a Fae Court and she was named Duchess of Autumn.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, Elva Autumnborn served the Fae and Elves of Nyresa, curing their sick and tending to the forest's autumnal needs. From a splinter in a finger to cleansing a grove of disease, no ailment was too small or great for Elva's attention, and she often visited the Sylvan Watchers to heal the injuries the warriors had suffered defending the forest, though she never dared fight herself.\r\n\r\nDuring missions to purge the corruption from the lost parts of the Mistwood, Elva assisted the Sylvan Watchers and made no small attempts to try to heal the damage caused by Siroth's corruption. On one of these vital excursions, she asked her family to join her so that they might lend their strength in healing the old and corrupted Heart Tree. But she had not foreseen the power of the malice that still thrived in its roots. She bid its leaves to fall and her family scattered them in the same ritual they had performed the day they had found her. Only this time, their magic was rejected. It was twisted and sullied, and rebounded back into them. They were poisoned from within, and they attuned to the corrupted old Rhythm. Their bodies decayed and their souls burned with a hatred for all creatures and spirits of the forest.\r\n\r\nCursed, the corrupted Fae lost all recognition of those whom they once loved, and turned on Elva with sudden ferocity. Elva was unable to subdue them, and so the Sylvan Watchers she was accompanying killed many and drove the survivors into the forest's darkest depths.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Elva Autumnborn began a new pursuit. Her body shifted, her beautiful vine-gowns hardening into armor and her face, which she had modeled after those of her family, she concealed behind a helmet of iron-hard bark.\r\n\r\nElva continued to accompany the Sylvan Watchers and tend to the forest, but no longer did she stay her hand from battle. To this day, she still searches for those of her family who escaped. If she cannot find a way to force the malice from their hearts, she will bring them a merciful end, hoping her family can know peace once again.\r\n\r\nYet the Sylvan Watchers have come to whisper of their concerns for Autumnborn’s sanity. Violent crimson veins can be seen glowing beneath her skin and the souls of those defeated by her scepter appear to linger around the weapon. Had she been of lesser strength, the years wandering the Mistwood’s lost lands might have turned her already. The Sylvan can only hope she is powerful enough to withstand the call of evil, else they may face a devastating adversary.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7380#static": "The bond shared between the Sylvan and the Mistwood remains a mystery to those outside the dark forest, and in truth many of the Sylvan who hear the Rhythm are unable to explain its workings. It endlessly evolves to the needs and wants of the masses, forever changing the forest and its people. Sometimes, those changes can affect the very nature of a Sylvan's character. Such is the case of the Fae known as Greenwarden Ruarc.\r\n\r\nIn the times before Darkness fell on the Mistwood, Ruarc was a frequent visitor of Sylvan halls. He would appear on a summer's breeze, shrouded in petals and leaves, to invite all gathered to compete in daring challenges. These varied greatly, including spoken games of mind and soul where contestants were asked to solve a riddle, define the beauties of the Mistwood, or to compose a song that could bring any listeners to tears. Many challenges were physical: a race on the wind, a climb to the forest's canopy, or a test of strength. \r\n\r\nRuarc's favorite challenge was a game of courage and honor. He would wander the woods and burst into the glade-halls of Sylvan lords, calling for them to use his famous Sword of the Glades to do unto him anything they desired. In return, he would repeat the act upon them. If challengers pleased him and respected the terms, Ruarc would offer them a gift he deemed worthy of the boldness and honor they displayed in the trial. Most challengers took up the sword and delivered a blow to Ruarc's body. This became a point of glory among those in the Sylvan court. The harder they hit and the deadlier their swing, the braver they were. As promised, Ruarc returned the strike, matching the exact point of contact and strength behind the blade.\r\n\r\nThe result was many scars from slashes across the chest or face, and stabs to the gut that healers would have to rush to mend. But if someone cowered from Ruarc when he came to return their blow, he sometimes cursed them to forever jump at shadows, for he would one day strike them in the dark, or promised to make them suffer every time they drank, for he would one day poison their water. Little to the cursed-one's knowledge, Ruarc would not deliver his threatened penalty, but the constant dread and paranoia that would plague them while awaiting their punishment was in itself enough of a curse for their cowardice.\r\n\r\nIt was to Ruarc’s greatest amusement that so few realized the full potential of this challenge – that they could simply do unto him an act of goodwill. A challenger could use the sword to help Ruarc complete his errands, such as defending the forest from interlopers. To these Sylvan, Ruarc returned their good deed and protected them and theirs, becoming a personal guardian who watched over them.\r\n\r\nWhen the first Heart Tree was corrupted, and the Rhythm changed, Ruarc's jovial air sombered. He could no longer divert himself with silly games or laugh with others. Instead he fought by their sides, his petals and soft smiles replaced by hard armor and an expressionless helm, to help him clear the Mistwood of Demonspawn and the corrupted. He found purpose in helping the forest to regrow in the wake of the devastation they caused, sowing new seeds for new life.\r\n\r\nCenturies have passed since that disaster, and an increasing desire to expand their lands spread among the Sylvan as the Rhythm began to drum a steady beat like marching feet, and vice versa. In the Mistwood, flowers sprouted thorns and trees oozed toxic sap, and Ruarc’s ruthlessness festered. He needed to see the Mistwood’s vines sprawl from the forest’s borders and choke all other life to take root in their remains.\r\n\r\nWhere once the Greenwarden's Sword of the Glades had been a part of well-intentioned games, and later a symbol of defiance and rebirth during the corruption, it had become a glorious tool of conquest. Leading raiding parties past the borders of the Mistwood, Ruarc preemptively attacked potential threats to the forest and tangled lands in barbed vines, wiping out all present life so as to make room for the expanding forest.\r\n\r\nThere are those who remember and lament the Greenwarden's old games and riddles. They believe that once the Mistwood is safe from outside threats, once it is vast and powerful enough to dissuade any thoughts of invasion from the minds of outsiders, the Rhythm and the forest may settle into a soothing tune. Ruarc might one day laugh and pose challenges of bravery and valor again.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7390#static": "Gallcobar is a name known and revered across Teleria. He is a Fae king of legend among the Sylvan, a great leader from a past time, and his credited exploits appear throughout centuries of history.\r\n\r\nThe Skyiron Dwarves have stone carvings depicting an Elven warrior wearing the hide of a Lizardman and slaughtering Demonspawn with a thorned staff. Scholars of Kaerok have centuries-old scrolls that record the efforts of a Sylvan king shrouded in vines who fought beside soldiers of the Free Cities against the Norr of Frostheim. The Elves of Aravia tell of how a vine-clad hero protected nobles from Dark Elf assassins. While the people he protects may differ, the form of this gallant warrior persists across time and place.\r\n\r\nGallcobar was a king of the Sylvan before Siroth’s corruption tarnished the Mistwood. Kind and just, he was a protector of the forest and a powerful mage who defended it against invaders. Most notable of his early battles was when he singlehandedly halted a clan of Dragonkin attempting to poach Mistwood wildlife. He summoned vines that struck like vipers to slash apart his foes, and his final opponent was the huge Dragonkin chieftain whom he pulverized with his staff. Ever after, he clad himself in armor crafted from the warrior's skin.\r\n\r\nWhile Gallcobar ranged the length of the Mistwood's borders to repulse intruders, the forest was afflicted by a terrible taint. Gallcobar sent scouts to investigate. Only one returned, with grave news of the Heart Tree’s corruption. He told the king of how his comrades had suddenly turned on each other in a maddened frenzy after approaching the Rhythm's source. Horrified, the king gathered a host of warriors and led the charge to the Heart Tree to face the growing threat head on.\r\n\r\nGallcobar found an evil tainting the Heart Tree and spreading through its roots to the whole forest. Demonspawn had infested the Heart Tree’s surrounding glens, and local Fae and spirits had devolved into crazed, murderous husks of their former selves.\r\n\r\nIn the fighting that ensued, Sylvan sacrificed their lives to defeat the Demonspawn but those who fell to the corruption bolstered the enemy’s numbers. Mages and healers worked tirelessly to find a cure for their madness and a solution to cleanse the Heart Tree. When a potential repellent for the malice was concocted, Gallcobar took it upon himself to deliver it to the Heart Tree in the first of many attempts over the years to purge the evil from its roots. Fighting his way through Demonspawn and vicious venomous vines, Gallcobar administered a concoction to the Tree but to no avail. During his heroic effort, one of the branches wielded by the corrupted Rhythm pierced the king’s flesh, infusing him with the darkness that had plagued so many Sylvan. In his desperation, Gallcobar injected himself with more of the purging remedy, slowing but not stopping the poison coursing through his veins that could someday take his mind.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle was over, and the Sylvan were defeated, Gallcobar rested. The corruption’s potency in his body grew and his control over his senses slipped. Black blood flowed through his veins, discoloring his skin. It was then that the Arbiter came to him and offered him a Shard. In exchange for an eternity of servitude to Lumaya, he would have effective immortality and the chance to see his people through this dark era. When summoned from the Shard, Gallcobar would once again be the hero he had been, before the corruption ever took hold of him. But the Arbiter warned that the corruption within him would fester again if he remained outside of his Shard for prolonged periods. He accepted the offer.\r\n\r\nGallcobar's Shard remained in the Sylvan’s possession so that they might call upon him to protect the forest in battle or to counsel his descendants, his vitality restored each time. Most pivotally, he was awakened to fight alongside Sylvan, Dwarves, and Shadowkin and help lead this unified army to a long awaited-victory in which the corruption's spread was halted. With the Mistwood saved from evil, Gallcobar could finally rest easy.\r\n\r\nBut the Arbiter still needed him. She took Gallcobar’s Shard across Teleria to defend besieged cities and save monarchs from certain death, but she also recognized the king’s wisdom. He helped people of all races to recover from the ravages of war and guided young monarchs in the art of rulership, and the green of his dragonskin armor became a promise of hope to Lumaya’s followers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Arbiter’s powers waned, she returned Gallcobar’s Shard to the Mistwood where he could rest surrounded by his trees and people, and told but a few Sylvan where it rested, should they need him in a time of great peril. Gallcobar faded into legend. A few souls today know where his Shard is hidden, and they hope the day will never come when they will need the aid of this mighty warrior.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7430#static": "Cormac the Highpeak could once be found at the Mistwood’s border, where the trees meet the foothills of the Cloudspire Mountains. Where many other Fae were born from blossoms or breeze, it was said that Cormac was born on a peak from a decaying carcass during the Scourge of Darkness, and his soul was broken. Plagued by constant pain, his only solace was to bathe in the blood of other beings, perhaps because it filled some unknown hole in his spirit.\r\n\r\nCormac herded animals to feed from, washing his body in their blood to temporarily ease his affliction, but only sick animals abandoned by their own herds or flocks would join him. Other Fae considered this repulsive, and so Cormac led a solitary life. But after many seasons, the soothing effects of his blood-bathing lessened, and he needed more and more blood to maintain himself. He decorated himself with bones, hoping that these remains might offer him some respite, but only blood seemed to suffice.\r\n\r\nBy chance, in a period when Cormac was suffering from prolonged untended pain, a Dwarf from the mountains found their way into the Fae's lair in search of the Mistwood’s richest resources. Angered by this trespass, Cormac ripped the Dwarf apart with his bare hands and felt a great surge of vitality as the Dwarf’s blood soaked his skin. Animals did not satiate him for long, but higher beings... their blood freed him of his ailment for as long as a moon’s cycle.\r\n\r\nConfined to the Mistwood by the limited range of the Rhythm, Cormac came up with increasingly devious ways to lure Dwarves, Humans, and other non-Sylvans to his lair. In the tree-city of Nyresa, the Sylvan Court welcomed Shadowkin and Dwarves, but rarely did these creatures travel the forest’s tangled outerlands. And so Cormac hid beside well-trodden paths, his skin blending him in with the undergrowth, and snatched unsuspecting victims from the back of convoys with his ram-horn crook. When extra guards were sent to protect the caravans, Cormac shed his solitude and hunted within society, mingling in Nyresa with foreign visitors and tricking them with a silver tongue to join him at his home where he drained them of their life-force.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the gentle Rhythm of the Mistwood has crescendoed into a harsher song. The Sylvan are seeking to expand the Mistwood in the name of defense against rising threats and to spread the Rhythm’s guidance across the world. Success in this could mean easy pickings for Cormac. An experienced manipulator, he wormed his way into the ears of Sylvan rulers, finding ground in the militaristic Elves. He whispered of ways to safeguard the forest and spread its influence in the greater world through conquest.\r\n\r\nThe Sylvan would not accept any harm to befall their Dwarf and Shadowkin allies, but they looked to plant seeds taken from the Mistwood in the lands beyond the Cloudspire Mountains and Yakai. The closest Humans in these lands were the Nomads who journeyed from camp to camp along the Krokhan Desert’s coast. Though a desert held poor soil for seeds, Cormac argued that the camps would be easy to take and would provide a useful path for the Sylvan to travel west more quickly. When the Monarc seemed reluctant to send warriors, Cormac volunteered to go alone.\r\n\r\nFor a Fae like Cormac, with the strength of an ox, sacking camps and destroying caravans became sport. He tore headfirst through men and women, ripping their bodies apart on his horned headdress. If any tried to run, he gutted them with his staff. He left every camp he attacked a charnel house and with his pain a fading memory.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7440#static": "Ruella has felled many foes with her savage bow of bone and sinew, but if one expands the profile of her lethality to include all the kills of those who learned archery under her tutelage, the number is truly staggering. That is why Ruella was among the Mikage Autocracy’s most hated foes during the years of turmoil that led to the ultimate downfall of their state. As one of the first agents sent by the Sylvan Court to intervene in the ongoing rebellion, she furthermore became a symbol to the Mikage Autocrats of the Sylvan’s infuriating meddling.\r\n\r\nRuella first won recognition leading a contingent of Shadowbows and Pathfinders patrolling the Mistwood’s borderlands. Ordered to stop the predation of Lizardmen reavers from the Lost Isles, she thwarted their raids repeatedly, and was successful enough to make grisly armor and a lizard-bone bow from the bodies of her slain foes. When she clashed against the Lizardmen one final time clad in their kin’s remains, they were suitably horrified into a rapid retreat. Her success led the Sylvan Court to choose her as a vanguard of their intervention in the Shadowkin rebellion, and dispatch her and her warriors to southern Yakai. \r\n\r\nIn her first action there, Ruella saw swarms of poorly-trained, lightly-armored, and inexperienced rebel levies trying, and failing, to break through a line of disciplined Mikage warriors and their shrewd leaders. These commanders were first to fall before Ruella’s volley of incredibly precise shots, and as rebels and oppressors alike reacted to the appearance of the Elf and her detachment, the Sylvan dashed away and repositioned. The chaos they sowed helped the rebels break apart the enemy formation and overrun it. Tired but triumphant, Ruella stood before the rebels and offered her service. Her performance had won the trust of those present, but the most influential rebel organizers took longer to persuade. Each one wished her to prove her loyalty with Mikage blood, which she readily supplied in a series of further battles. It became clear that she was an excellent field leader, and soon she was attached to companies of rebel archers. Here, Ruella truly shone. She turned the rebel archery corps from a gaggle of duck hunters, hobbyists, and elderly retired soldiers into a fighting force to match or exceed their Mikage counterparts. \r\n\r\nYears of insurrection passed and more Sylvan arrived in Yakai to support the rebels. But, even as it became clear the Shadowkin would prevail, Ruella grew bored with her tutelary role. She was also suffering from her prolonged absence from the Mistwood, which caused her connection to the great Rhythm – the shared emotional awareness that defines the Sylvan – to diminish. Homesickness clutched her heart in an intense, unique way no non-Sylvan could comprehend. Yet she was duty-bound, and came to have great personal investment in the rebels’ cause and ideals. So she endured.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last of the Autocrats still loyal to Siroth was overthrown and Ruella was recalled to Nyresa. But the Rhythm she reconnected to was not as it had been before the war. A subtle pulse of militaristic aggression ran through it, mingling with and amplifying her lingering personal frustrations at having missed out on battlefield glory in Yakai. Though only just returned from years of strife, she departed on an expedition to punish her old foes, the Lizardmen of the Lost Isles, despite advanced age beginning to tell upon her. But enroute she vanished at sea, her fate uncertain to this day.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7480#static": "The saga of the Verminlord and the Breaker has become a staple in every alehouse and bard’s college across Teleria. The truth of the story is thus all the more obscure, and buried in one of the darkest chapters in the history of the Free City of Arnoc. In the Age of Treachery the rate of Skinwalker awakenings exploded, and the resulting turmoil nearly ended the history of Kaerok before it began. The period suffers from a lack of hard historical evidence and first-hand accounts, as is so often the case in times of great crisis – few had time to record the ravages unfolding around them, and fewer still possessed the will to honestly and accurately describe the gruesome truths. \r\n\r\nIn the case of Gnishak, it is indisputable that a noble prince became a monstrous menace. But the house of his provenance, his lineage or surviving relations, his siblings, his issue, all go historically unrecorded. This is highly unusual for a nobleman of Kaerok. Even in periods of great upheaval, they were and are careful to preserve such information, for it is the source of much of their legitimacy and thus their power. This suggests that the relevant information was purged deliberately, perhaps to protect the dignity of those related to the fallen Skinwalker-prince. This omission allowed the Verminlord to become iconic, a stand-in for every corrupt and petty overlord who lacked empathy for lesser beings, making the story all the more popular as it spread. In the tale, Gnishak casually kills a rat underfoot and is cursed by its vengeful spirit. Many hearers wished similar vengeance upon one lord or another. Some felt as if they were the ‘rats’ in the story themselves, or their friends, or relatives, all feeling crushed under a noble boot. \r\n\r\nAfter his transformation, Gnishak disappeared into the sewers and quietly grew his festering power in the depths for thirteen long years. Out of sight and out of mind as more overt Skinwalkers wrought havoc above, Gnishak cultivated mastery over the swarms of rats he would have once disdained. Another tale of a deadly ‘Rat-man,’ the wandering killer Sniktraak – who also attracted and exploited a swarm of rats – is often conflated with the Verminlord narrative. But where Sniktraak was an impoverished peasant who killed rats to make ends meet, Gnishak was a petty princeling who killed casually while dreaming of greatness. Correspondingly, where Sniktraak’s horde was a crawling, chaotic manifestation of their master’s torment and madness, the legendary swarm of the Verminlord was an army of soldiers wielded by a mad monarch. Gnishak coveted the vast demesne and legions of followers he always felt he deserved, and he carefully directed his growing rat army to gnaw out a vast and impenetrable lair for him, enlarging and augmenting swathes of the sewers of Arnoc into his personal castle. He even dressed his bloated, hairy form in the fine clothing he had taken with him after his flight, and had new and hideous adornments made for him to match his delusional new title of lordship. \r\n\r\nThen, when the time was right and all of Arnoc was gathering in dense crowds to celebrate the holy lights of the Yuletide festival, Gnishak unleashed a long-plotted act of terror against the surface-world. Boiling up from the grates and dripping hosepipes, pouring from every opening of building after building as each was overrun in turn, the rat-tide he unleashed was hideous to behold, all the more so for the vile pestilence that coursed in their diseased veins. Each one was laden with grotesque pustules that spread a pox the likes of which no healer on the face of Teleria had ever witnessed. Had Gnishak found a way to manipulate the forces of plague and pestilence, or had the virus simply developed within his swarm on its own? No one knows for sure, though it was said that the plague had a fell tenacity and almost living will as it wracked its victims. Most folk believe the Verminlord’s Plague originated with the Verminlord himself, and that he poured into it all his malice and spite and his urge to debase all that was upright and wholesome.\r\n\r\nNo remedy, whether poultice or potion or purifying magic, could do more than slow a victim’s doom and prolong the agony. There could be only one solution: the eradication of the swarm and its terrible source alike. As brave citizens battled the rats with torches, spears, and bullwhips, one spotted the Rat-King himself returning to his subterranean lair after a brief sortie. This man, a professional rat-catcher in many tellings of the tale, presented this evidence to Arnoc’s council of burghers, who were aghast to learn that Gnishak had been lurking below their feet all along. This set the stage for the rise of Georgid the Breaker.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7490#static": "Once a stable boy of no renown, Taras was trained as a soldier after being drafted into an army of Count Iradere, known to many as ‘Iradere the Sly’ behind his back.\r\n\r\nWhile he lived, Iradere was infamous for his implication in crimes apparently committed by various higher-ranking Banner Lords he served under. While his then lords were often found guilty, Iradere explained any charges directed against himself away with effective alibis and a lack of discernible motive.\r\n\r\nThough considered untrustworthy, he proved to be an effective local magistrate, ruling justly and largely without incident. Indeed, he was known for being able to turn seemingly unusable land into a profitable fiefdom. This all came to an end when he chose to use a man called Taras in a plot to incite conflict with a neighboring lord, Sersaul the Thunder.\r\n\r\nIradere had two hundred lowborn men, Taras included, trained for battle. He intended to adorn them with bannerless armor and have them raid an outpost within Sersaul’s land. It would seem as though a mercenary group had been hired by an unknown lord to conduct the attack. Sersaul, famous for his perceptive nature but quick temper, would correctly assume Iradere was involved, but not bother to investigate the matter fully, and counterattack immediately. Iradere would then claim the attack was without provocation, use it as an excuse to enter and overwhelm Sersaul’s weaker forces, and put Sersaul to the sword before he could be questioned on the matter. Iradere would likely be granted some if not all Sersaul’s land as recompense for what would seem to be an unprovoked attack.\r\n\r\nYoung Taras was no fool, however, and was aware of Iradere’s reputation. Accepting the training, he proved a talented leader and was placed in command of the force, but when his orders arrived, Taras deserted as soon as he was able. This forced Iradere to postpone his plans until he could capture and kill Taras, because he expected Taras to seek out Sersaul and inform him of the plot immediately. Iradere forewarned his network of spies and assassins – known in hushed tones as Iradere’s Whisperers – of Taras’ most likely next move.\r\n\r\nBut Taras was craftier than Lord Iradere could have ever envisioned for a mere stable boy. Rather than seeking to inform any higher authority for fear of being seen as a liar, and having heard the rumors of his lord’s Whisperers, Taras instead chose to remain within Iradere’s lands and pose as a beggar, the population of which many Whisperers were recruited from. Muddying his face, growing out his beard and running filth through his hair proved an effective enough disguise. Taras was quickly adopted into the Whisperers’ circle by a clueless novice and was kept abreast of all his own supposed sightings, at times delivering false notice of his own movements to his fellow Whisperers.\r\n\r\nAfter several weeks, Taras claimed to know where he himself was hiding, but refused to divulge the information to any but Iradere himself. Smuggled into the lord’s keep in the dead of night to a secret meeting – he revealed his identity to the horror of the unsuspecting Iradere, and quickly cut down the lord and his sole guard. He then fled into the night, safe in the knowledge he had rid the world of a duplicitous schemer and secured his own immediate safety.\r\n\r\nBut life did not become easier for Taras immediately. He wandered, avoiding any major settlements for fear of discovery, hunting as best he could with the little experience he had. He eventually stumbled his way into the hamlet known as Oakfell, east of Durham Forest, where he collapsed from hunger. The folk who dwelt there fed and clothed him as though he were one of their own. Once his strength returned, he served them as a town guard until he had trained enough of the local men to look after themselves, and he took his leave.\r\n\r\nFrom there, Taras roamed Teleria as a sell-sword under several false names, often hearing greatly exaggerated versions of his own tale from the mouths of bards. He lived this way for several decades, perfecting his fighting techniques, taking only contracts issued from reputable sources, and living free. He grew old and stoic, but never forgot the plight of those like him – those who had to fight for their lot in life.\r\n\r\nIt was in these later years that he met one Marichka the Unbreakable and their fates changed forever.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7500#static": "For the longest time, Marichka’s life did not seem blessed. Born into the service of Malevena Neferas, a Dark Elven sorceress, all Marichka knew of her true parents is what she was told. Her mother had been taken captive, and her father killed, in a raid by Malevena's servants on a trade caravan. Malevena attempted to ransom Marichka's mother back to several lords, but she had refused to tell them her name, and no lord would pay the ransom for an unnamed hostage. So, Marichka's mother was placed into servitude within Malevena's derasar – the sorceress' temple – the Sanctum of Midnight Dreams. Weeks later, she died in labor. Feeling a twisted form of pity for the orphan Marichka, Malevena chose to raise her as her own. But the dark sorceress saw only an opportunity to raise an apprentice, not a child. Marichka was forced into intense training and study of shadow magic as soon as she was able to walk. For two decades, her every waking hour was filled with study, practice, and evaluation in the immediate presence of her mistress.\r\n\r\nAfter she had become a formidable sorceress in her own right, Marichka escaped the derasar by using a spell to blast through its six walls.\r\n\r\nMalevena sent dozens of mercenaries after Marichka, but the girl's skills as a sorceress made her difficult to track. Still, magic leaves traces, and the sorceress’ servants were able to pursue her to the plains of Tilshire, east of Durham Forest.\r\n\r\nAs Marichka sprinted across the plains, hunters at her heels, she slung spell after spell behind her to maim or kill as many as she could. Her attempts caught the attention of wandering Taras, who had been traveling to Tilshire to claim a bounty. He turned his horse to the battle and rode to the aid of the lone girl, saber drawn.\r\n\r\nTaras rode down many of Marichka’s pursuers before his horse was run through with a spear. He leapt from his steed before it fell to the ground, and laid Malevena’s hunters low. He cut them down one by one, his saber a storm, his strikes lightning. Marichka joined the fight, hurling spells at any who threatened to overwhelm her savior. Together, they drove her pursuers into a retreat.\r\n\r\nTaras brought Marichka to his homestead, in the north of the Tilshire plains, where she could recuperate, and form plans for the immediate future.\r\n\r\nMarichka was not quick to trust Taras, for in the derasar, no kindness was without an unspoken expectation. She took leave in the night, but not without Taras’ keen ears hearing a gate clatter close. He followed her, for her own protection.\r\n\r\nThis proved wise, for Malevena, furious at the failure of the first party, had come for Marichka herself. Unbeknownst to Marichka and Taras, the remnants of the first party had followed them at a careful distance, found the homestead, and had then taken this knowledge to their mistress. As Marichka skulked through the night, she was ambushed.\r\n\r\nFighting off her attackers in a strategic retreat back to Taras' homestead, Marichka bought herself enough time for Taras to see flashes of magic in the distance. While dozens of Malevena’s untrained fanatics posed little threat to Marichka and Taras, the presence of the dark sorceress gave Marichka little hope of escape.\r\n\r\nOnly the knowledge that Malevena wanted her alive gave Marichka the edge. Using the most dangerous magic she knew, she launched explosive fireballs, deadly miasmic clouds, and sharpened stones at her mistress. Malevena was forced onto the defensive, enraged that she had taught Marichka too much too quickly. Taras fought off the foot soldiers with ease, with the light of clashing spells bathing the battlefield in eerie glows of crimson, green, and yellow.\r\n\r\nAs her fighters were slain around her, Malevena reluctantly ordered a retreat, fearing the combined might of her relentless enemy. While the battle was lost, Malevena chose to bide her time – the opportunity to reclaim her apprentice would one day present itself.\r\n\r\nTaras returned home with a weak and frail Marichka. The old warrior nursed the wounded sorceress back to health, doting on Marichka day and night until she recovered. She was so moved by Taras' care for her that when the time came for her to leave, Marichka refused to go. An unbreakable bond had been forged. From that point on, Taras took care of her as a daughter, not an apprentice, and Marichka learned all she could from the wise man of the plains. The two fought side by side for many years, entering at annals of legend as stalwart defenders of those who yearn for freedom. They are now said to ride together at the head of the Arbiter's host, heralded by hoofbeats and a bold song of victory.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7510#static": "Why is Georgid, folk hero of Arnoc and savior of the hallowed Yuletide, known as the Breaker? There are many answers, and each is true, for it is a name he has earned many times over, in infamy and in glory.\r\n\r\nWhen his tale begins, Georgid is a breaker of an oath. He renounced his loyalty to the Free City he once served – which in particular goes unrecorded, as do any other identifying details about the man once known as Sir Georgid. During the dreadful War of Kaerok, with fractures and infighting among the Free Cities, there were many who became disillusioned with the knightly vows they had sworn to men who turned out to be squabbling, visionless leaders. Other deserter-knights were content to wile away their days as mercenaries, thugs, or guardsmen, and hide their fall from grace in the anonymity of the past. But not Georgid.\r\n\r\nThat he was willing to give his life over to the Free City of Arnoc makes Georgid a breaker, then, of expectations, in comparison to the many so-called noble warriors who nonetheless quailed, stalled, and dissembled when the call went out from the Free City for a champion. The dreadful days of the Verminlord’s Plague, unleashed by dread Gnishak upon the city on the hallowed Yuletide Eve, had raged unabated for nigh on a year. With the grim Yuletide anniversary of the plague approaching, the will of the people was about to break and Arnoc’s councilmen were desperate for answers. Thanks to a humble townsman they had learned of Gnishak’s lair in the sewers, but braving those depths to find and kill the mad Skinwalker monarch was a prospect that chilled the souls of even doughty Kaerok knights, fanatics of the Sacred Order, and Arnoc’s own garrison troops. But there was one man who had nothing to lose and redemption to gain, or so he believed, and Georgid the Breaker broke the ominous silence that answered the councilmen’s call to arms. \r\n\r\nGeorgid declared that he would slay Gnishak Verminlord or die trying, never to return either in defeat nor victory, for no matter the outcome he would surely be corrupted beyond hope by the horrid works of the plague-bringer and his swarm. He vowed to break the oozing fortress of the Verminlord, or break himself upon it. Oathbreaker though he had been in a past life, he swore his love for the good folk of Arnoc and all Teleria, his devotion to Lumaya and her Light, and the holy Yule that was meant to be a beacon of that Light in the darkest days. He swore it would shine through him this Yule, even if in a hopeless struggle.\r\n\r\nThe gods may not always appear to listen, and cannot answer every prayer, but they are fickle, and may be audient to pleas. On that day, so the tales tell, Lumaya sent Sir Nicholas, avatar of the Yuletide and saint of her Light, to the very council chamber where Georgid stood. All present were struck with awe, and the proud men who had shunned the call to arms were humbled and knew shame. But Nicholas had not come for that purpose, and spoke forthwith with Georgid. \r\n\r\n‘Would you give up your very skin and flesh to save the Yule?’ Sir Nicholas asked. Georgid's answer was yes. ‘Then be you clad in skin that shall never break and flesh that shall never tire, and armed with blades that shall pierce any plate. Grim-faced and iron-clad you will go down into the darkness below where the Light of Lumaya cannot reach, knowing that no taint shall touch you nor filth cling to you. You shall be our perfect soldier, and break this siege 'ere the passing of the sacred Yuletide.’ \r\n\r\nWith a flash Sir Nicholas was gone, and his words were true, for Georgid had changed. He was encased from head to toe in plates of holy armor bonded to his mortal form, his face a mask of steel determination. He spoke not, instead marching into the stinking bowels of the sewers of Arnoc. And though his armored form was proof against all its horrors, the words of his original vow rang true, for he never emerged from the foul depths in triumph. But as Sir Nicholas the Lightbringer had prophesied, the rat-siege of Gnishak Verminlord was broken, and the weary defenders and traumatized survivors knew joy and light on the Yuletide that came. Like the breaking of a fever the malignant plague finally subsided as the pestilent rats vanished into the darkness, to be feared and remembered for all time, but seen no longer. The fate of both the Verminlord and the Breaker will never be known, but their story will be told for eternity.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7520#static": "Born the daughter of a noble Aravian house, Tramaria was but a child when the War of the Elves began. Her parents were among those renegades who studied shadow magic, and they taught it to her. She proved to have an aptitude for the forbidden knowledge, and soon her skill outstripped that of her tutors. \r\n\r\nAs the war went against the Dark Elves, Tramaria’s family was forced into exile. They retreated to the fastness of Durham Forest, a place unlike any she had ever known. She had been a creature of palaces and manicured gardens; now, she slept in a tent, haunted by the scuttling of unseen creatures. \r\n\r\nThe next few years were a trying time for Tramaria. Her family had been forced to leave behind much of the wealth that might have brought them some comfort in the frontier settlements of Durham Forest. Instead of being at the top of the societal food chain, they were forced to congregate with the lesser nobility, somewhere in the middle of the new hierarchy that was beginning to form. Neither the poorest, nor the richest. Neither the most influential, nor the least.\r\n\r\nTramaria retreated into studies of the arcane, even as her people descended into anarchy. With the end of the War of the Elves, and the formal exile of the Dark Elves to Durham Forest, the latter fought among themselves for power. Tramaria became obsessed with unlocking the secrets of the strange, wickedly bladed and barbed scepter that had once been a symbol of her family’s authority in Aravia, believing that it might hold the key to regaining their lost power and influence. \r\n\r\nThe scepter was centuries old, a relic of times long forgotten. For much of that, her family had considered it nothing more than an heirloom and weapon; a symbol of their superiority over the other noble families. But to Tramaria it was something more. The gem integrated within the blade seemed to whisper to her, in the dark of the night, in her dreams. It called to her, beckoning her to wield it… as if it were meant for her. As if it were her destiny.\r\n\r\nTramaria’s family, meanwhile, threw themselves into the ongoing conflict, hoping to improve their status and reclaim something of their old power or even to rule the Dark Elves themselves. But when the dust settled and order had been established, Tramaria’s family had been all but wiped out. Those who survived, fled. Tramaria hid herself away in an isolated village, far from those who might otherwise have sought her death in reprisal for the actions of her family during the fighting. Soon, all memory of her had faded away entirely.\r\n\r\nWhen Tramaria finally emerged from her self-imposed isolation several decades later, it was not as the daughter of a disgraced house but a woman of intent. In her exile she had learned how to draw out the malign power nestled in the mystic gemstone at its core, and had added its strength to her own, using it to greatly enhance her already-formidable arcane abilities, as well as increase her longevity. The staff was bound to her, and she to it, in ways even she did not fully understand.\r\n\r\nWith the staff, Tramaria was a sorceress equal to any who had ever emerged from the academies of Ireth or Aravia, and she intended to use her power to reclaim all that had been taken from her. But she had learned from her family’s mistakes. They had sought to rule through open violence and short-sighted treachery – she chose another path. \r\n\r\nTramaria started slowly; warily. Backroom deals and whispered promises served to reintroduce her to a society that had long since forgotten her name, she using her magic to dull the wits of her interlocutors to gain herself further advantage. What her kin had lost through vainglory and hubris, she intended to regain through guile, subtle application of skill, and force of will. At first, she sold her magic the way a warrior might sell their skill with a blade, but was wary of revealing the full extent of her power. The internecine feuding between the Dark Elves was ripe for mercenary work, especially of the mystical kind. \r\n\r\nTramaria parlayed her skills to wind herself into positions of influence first within the guilds, then with the noble houses. She has quickly become a trusted advisor to many notable families and institutions but, as with her magic, she is always careful not to show just how much influence she truly wields. Bit by bit, she has made herself indispensable to the descendants of those who’d once sought her death, and become an integral factor in the continued survival of her people. But Tramaria is not satisfied with simply serving the aims of others. She has plans of her own. And one day, she will have back all that was taken from her.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7580#static": "The tolling of the bells in Anhelt was once a call for brave soldiers to take up arms, or a sign of victory and blessings. Now, many are cautious when they hear a distant chime. It may belong to Korugar Death-Bell. As a mockery of those who had wronged his kin, this Ogryn warrior took up the holy symbol of the bells and anointed them in blood.\r\n\r\nLike many of his kin, Korugar grew up with a view over the City of Lost Dreams – a once magnificent city, now a husk of fallen pride, thanks to the armies of the Telerian League. Even as a youth, Korugar understood the injustice scorched into the earth and listened with ever growing rage to the Orcs and Lizardmen who ranted about the Humans and their beautiful stone cities. It was surprising to none when he picked up an ax and joined a raiding force, determined to exact what revenge they could.\r\n\r\nKorugar traveled the world with his band of Gaellen comrades. The further he ventured, the more he saw how his kin suffered, exiled to far reaches of forests and wastelands, or living among Humans and Elves as little more than servants as they were. His youthful rage became a bloodlust. He had found a cause worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nProving himself a leader, Korugar defended Skinwalker settlements, assisted Lizardmen raids, and liberated Ogryn from oppression. The more he fought and the larger his band grew, the more his infamy spread across Anhelt.\r\n\r\nNews of this fierce band of Gaellen rebels unsettled the coastal-dwelling Human and High Elven nobles, some of whom now thought twice before turning away a cold Skinwalker or underpaying their Ogryn farmhands. But to the Gaellens, the name Korugar was a spark of hope. A budding flame of pride began to smolder among the Ogryn, something they had rarely felt since the time before the loss of their great City of Dreams. They shared tales of a great warrior who fought for Gaellen justice and a fairer world. A leader who fought in the vanguard with his comrades and defended the wounded.\r\n\r\nKorugar’s reputation led Ogryn from all corners of the world to heed his call to arms and join his ever expanding force. Besides brave fighters came Ogryn of many talents – cooks, builders, and craftsmen were among the many who came to join Korugar in his efforts. One of these craftsmen supplied warriors with sturdy steel and forged a new, flaming ax for Korugar.\r\n\r\nWith his army behind him, Korugar headed to Aravia and marched into the towns and villages from which his people had been driven. He demanded that the citizens pay for the mistreatment of the Gaellen races and that they mend the wrongs of their ancestors by allowing Gaellen folk to reside in the lands as equal citizens. When Korugar was refused, he left those towns and villages as smoldering ash. Yet with every battle, his forces were only met with more resistance.\r\n\r\nKorugar moved gradually south, indiscriminately attacking Elf and Human settlements. But his campaign was halted at a small town of little prior importance, where Korugar and his army suffered its first defeat. When Korugar arrived at the town walls, he was met by ringing bells and an army of the Sacred Order. The battle was long and the losses were many. While Korugar risked his life to save one warrior, another would fall. For every knight he cut down, two of his warriors met their end.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sacred Order rang their ceremonial bells for the second time, it signaled their victory, and Korugar knelt, wounded and exhausted, surrounded by the bodies of his warriors. As Humans celebrated, Korugar was forced to withdraw, the bells mocking his failure. The ringing stayed long in his head, taunting him in his sleep. In the weeks following his defeat, he rebuilt his forces and vowed he’d never again retreat. Korugar later returned to the site of the battle – this time his army crushed the Sacred Order’s knights and Korugar took the town’s bells as trophies.\r\n\r\nKorugar continues to fight for his kin, the once holy bells he carries now announcing his arrival on the battlefield. Soldiers and knights have learnt not to trust distant chimes, for not all signal an approaching priest or traveling merchant. Too many tales have been told by wounded survivors of a haunting peal of bells before death descended upon their ranks. When the bells toll, living with the shame of fleeing from battle seems a fair price for many soldiers, for the Death-Bell shows no mercy.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7590#static": "In a time of chaos, the legions of Siroth ravaged the lands of Teleria, and the Dragonkin Empire as it was known was changed forever. In the ashes of The First Great War, the empire collapsed, its people ultimately leaving behind their former title in favor of a new beginning, calling themselves Lizardmen. In the heart of this era of reform, Pythion was born – a Lizardman blessed with wings, an extremely rare trait which resulted in shamans believing that he possessed the blood of dragons. This, they said, was a wondrous omen, one that may signify the dawn of a new age, one of hope and ambition for all Lizardmen. As Pythion grew older, the weight of expectation became arduous for him. He only found comfort in the words of his brother Skirax, who became his most trusted confidant. Skirax reassured his sibling that he was worthy of the praise he received for his tactical skill and magical ability. With his brother to guide and advocate for him, Pythion came to lead his clan with Skirax as his most trusted advisor.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, Pythion came to fully embrace the prophecies, finally feeling worthy of the revelations that had once burdened him. With a fire of inspiration burning in his heart, Pythion was able to manifest the inconceivable, achieving unity between his people. After uniting multiple Lizardmen clans beneath his banner, the new era of prophesied rebirth and peace felt agonizingly tangible. The shamans continued to speak of his potential, singing praises as they reminisced of a time where the Dragonkin had ruled earth, sky, and sea, sparking Pythion’s desire for great conquest. Pythion called a great meeting to gather the loyal clans in the Sorrowlakes, declaring plans for great expansion – a war upon any who dared challenge the place of the Lizardman within Teleria.\r\n\r\nAfter gathering the clans at what became known as the Grand Moot of the Sorrowlakes to relay news of oncoming war, Pythion was met with betrayal. The elders of the united Lizardmen clans watched in utter dismay as Skirax came forward, challenging Pythion’s urging of war and shattering the union they had once shared. Disheartened by Pythion’s thirst for conflict, Skirax declared his brother disillusioned by the power foretold about him. He recounted the Sin of Dragons – a monumental event caused by the Dragonkin in which Siroth's hordes were given means to return to the mortal plane and terrorize Teleria – to all. The unspeakable sin was a result of the all-consuming pride of the Dragonkin, he said, and that he would not see the Lizardmen repeat that mistake. Pythion retorted in rage, and the brothers who once stood at each other's sides were unable to find common ground. They left the moot as enemies, the clans now forced to divide and choose loyalty to one of the brothers.\r\n\r\nEach brother amassed followers as the ideological conflict continued. Many Lizardmen felt war was imminent, the once-promised age of rebirth and reinvention only leading them to another cursed crossroad instead. On the eve of assured combat, Pythion was greeted by a being of legendary status. It was the last prince, Ramantu Drakesblood, an idol of the First Great War who had fought against the legions of Siroth that had come before. He warned Pythion of the Dragonkin's hubris – how the empire had fallen, and how a figure held in such glittering esteem could be a force of impending destruction. This fate was something Pythion could picture all too easily. The two Lizardmen spoke in confidence throughout the night, sharing tales of past and present. As dawn broke, Pythion laid down his weapon and went to speak with his sibling alone. Skirax, overcome with joy, welcomed his brother with open arms, and they laid their rivalry to rest. They emerged together swearing an oath that the Lizardmen would never repeat the horrors of the past. As the Lizardmen sheathed their weapons, the brothers realized that they had fulfilled the prophecies spoken over Pythion when he was born in their uniting of so many of their people.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the resolution, a tradition would spawn with the location of the Grand Moot of Sorrowlakes coming to serve as a neutral meeting point – a space that provided future generations a place to settle disputes and forge alliances, one that would act as the birthplace of the legendary alliance known as the Gaellen Pact.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7600#static": "Leader of one of the largest cattle-rustling gangs in Peltas, Loriaca is also known as the Greathoof, a title she claims as equal to that of any lord or potentate of any land. Her lair is somewhere in the Dawnmounts, the range that separates the Stormwind Wastes from the Krokhan Desert, bisecting the continent of Peltas. To the south is the great Arena City of Velyzar and the coast. \r\n\r\nNeither the arid Krokhan nor the blasted highlands of Stormwind could support the prosperity of Velyzar on their own, so the city relies heavily on import and trade to obtain essential foods. This includes huge numbers of cows and bullocks. The cattle are led east by drovers from the rich grazing-lands around Tilshire in eastern Anhelt, crossing the Valdemar Strait by boat and into Peltas. From there, the wranglers traverse ancient trade routes from oasis to oasis across the inhospitable desert. Loriaca was one of these rugged drovers, facing constant dangers – stampedes, the brutal heat and dryness, predatory wildlife, and rustlers from among the native clans. \r\n\r\nThese impoverished Nomad rustlers eked out a tenuous existence between two harsh environments – they ate or starved based on the success or failure of their raids. By contrast, Loriaca’s paymasters were wealthy ranchers who were often insured against any losses, and she was paid her full wage so long as those losses were below an acceptable threshold. At first she hated the rustlers, but in time she came to pity them. When she let an emaciated-looking raider escape with one of the herd, the other drovers suspected these sympathies and treated her more coldly.\r\n\r\nThe turning point came when Loriaca was assigned to guard a herd of prize cattle of a particularly rare and valuable breed, which lured a large force of Nomad raiders with the promise of huge black market profits. Many of her cohort were killed and the rest fled. Loriaca surrendered and was taken hostage, and made to wait for miserable, agonizing months as a ransom demand was sent to her employer in distant Tilshire. When a reply finally arrived, it was terse and unequivocal: respectable businessmen do not negotiate with extortionists. No help was forthcoming.\r\n\r\nLoriaca's captors were left with an undesirable extra mouth to feed. Many voted to leave her to die in the desert. But the same young Nomad who she had previously allowed to escape with a cow repaid her now by speaking on her behalf. As she was a skilled warrior and already familiar with the terrain, he advocated that they recruit Loriaca rather than abandon her. The doubters were eventually swayed, and Loriaca was freed on the condition that she learn their ways and respect their culture. She spent many months mistrusted and afraid, but her knowledge of the inner workings of the cattle-drives made her an invaluable asset and eventually the clan accepted her. \r\n\r\nJust as Loriaca was beginning to embrace her new life, a raid went wrong. A sudden, unexpected thunderclap panicked the herd of cattle, which broke into a wild stampede. Thrown from her horse and faced with a thundering wall of heaving flesh and crushing hooves, Loriaca survived by using her mighty hammer to crush the skull of the first cow to reach her and hid behind the corpse – the stampede flowed around it like a living river and she was safe, at least in part. She lay there, writhing in agony in the throes of transformation after the dead cow's soul plunged into her body. When the dust settled, she was a Skinwalker, now similar in aspect to the slain cow. When all was done she rose to her feet. The warriors of her clan had fled, presumably thinking her trampled. With nowhere else to go, she trudged back to their tents. There, once again, her adopted clan debated her future, and once again decided to give her a chance to prove herself. \r\n\r\nRefusing to let her circumstances beat her, Loriaca continued leading cattle raids, for her transformation had only enhanced her capabilities in battle. For four years, her notoriety built and her leadership improved. By this time the clan’s leader, an aged man ready to retire, had seen enough, and appointed her as his successor. Impressed by her prowess, several other Nomad clans also swore allegiance to her. She gathered them in a great moot, and proclaimed herself their Greathoof – styled after the military titles used by Skinwalkers in the Gaellen Pact armies. Her raider coalition is now more than a transient nuisance, it is a nascent war-horde with reach all across Peltas.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7610#static": "The tragedy of the Mistwood’s lost Heart Tree has left a scar on all Sylvan beings, few more so than Searsha the Charred, the Fae once beloved as the Emerald Dryad. The Sylvan rarely speak of this fallen spirit, for her story is one of many from those dark times and it holds a truth too painful for many to bear: it is among the starkest tales of what was lost.\r\n\r\nThe Emerald Dryad was one of the most peaceful and radiant of the Mistwood folk. A nurturer of the forest and protector of its creatures, the Dryad spent her early years playing the wind through the trees to friendly spirits in her glen. Naught an evil root beneath her, she never wished harm upon a living thing and loved dearly all that was good and pure born of the Heart Tree’s grace.\r\n\r\nSo it was all the more terrible that the Emerald Dryad was among those taken by the corruption that came to infest the ancient Heart Tree and spread from it.\r\n\r\nThe Dryad’s woodland friends wilted and died in the place they had once called sanctuary, at the twisted hands of the one they had once called the fairest of the emerald trees. Never did the songs they had once shared calm her fury, nor did their dying cries move her blackened heart. Some spirits able to escape the corruption believed their lost friends had been veiled in madness and that their true selves were dormant within their bodies, and as such they gave the Dryad’s new form the name Searsha, the ‘lady that is blind’. Though her old friends hoped to restore Searsha’s sanity, sorrowful parts of them wished she was truly lost and blind to her dreadful new existence.\r\n\r\nSearsha haunted her once serene glades, led by the ancient Rhythm’s now destructive song. She trampled the beautiful flowers, and crushed the life from any creatures or Fae that ventured into her path.\r\n\r\nDuring the final battle to halt the corruption of the Heart Tree, Searsha's glen became a site of carnage. Searsha met Sylvan, Dwarf, and Shadowkin warriors with the full fury of her warped soul. In the wider conflict, her enemies were victorious, and they set the Heart Tree alight. The roaring enchanted flames that spread from the Sacred Grove consumed her glen, as they did her body, and her agony was matched only by that of the rage and anguish in her soul at what had happened. Ablaze with the magical flames, the corruption in her heart and mind evaporated, and the fire found an eternal home within her, changing her body forever. The Dryad was emerald no more.\r\n\r\nThe corruption within her thus quelled, Searsha awoke from what had felt like an endless slumber in the clutches of evil. But to her horror, her violent nightmares of a blood-soaked and soot-covered grove had all been real. She gazed upon the settling ashes of the forest she had cherished so dearly. The wind that she had once duetted with no longer sang its songs of glee, but carried the cinders of her beloved once-dancing trees and smiling flowers like a callous reaper.\r\n\r\nThe once-Emerald Dryad’s wails echoed across the devastated landscape. She wept for the years she had lost, the years she had taken from her friends, for her precious glen that had once been a haven for all that was good and kind, and how she had transformed it into a killing field.\r\n\r\nThe phantom touch of the destructive, corrupted Rhythm lingered in the back of her memory. Searsha remembered how it had called to her, commanded her mind, body, and soul to commit her atrocities. Clenching the ashes of her home in her burning fists, the Dryad screamed of the vengeance she would take on the evil that had tainted her heart and ultimately caused her home to be ruined.\r\n\r\nWhen Sylvan Watchers surrounded her with weapons in hand, Searsha did not attack them. She only demanded they tell her who was responsible for the desecration. The Watchers told her of Siroth and his dark schemes, and dubbed her Searsha the Charred Dryad as her flaming form vanished into the forest’s depths, where she commenced her hunt.\r\n\r\nTo this day, the Charred Dryad seeks retribution against the servants of evil. The Sylvan tell the young that the forest is safer than it was but warn not to look upon the dark reckoner. The once-beautiful Fae stops at nothing in her quest for revenge and will sear any who stand in her way from the face of Teleria. Above all, they say Searsha the Charred is a terrible reminder of what all of the Mistwood has become; a symbol of a hurt people and all that was taken from them, and the retribution they crave for it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7620#static": "Akemtum, in his life in the form of both Human and Skinwalker, has always lived in the shadow of dread Ireth, city of immortal madmen. Long ago the mages there sought the secrets of life and death, and the machinations of ever-living necromancers plagued by madness brought the once-thriving metropolis to a state of rotting, horrific ruin. Few sane living beings tread willingly into the center of Ireth, but on the outskirts there exist slums that house the few living mortal remnants of the fallen city-state. They cling to what sustenance they can, and collect fees to act as liaisons between the mad alchemist-princes and the wider world. Ireth may fester with corruption, but its coin remains highly persuasive.\r\n\r\nAkemtum was a slum-dweller, feeling forever trapped between the inner rot and the outer desert. He was a nobody, who became a thief and then a killer. His methods included using metal claws to slash his targets to ribbons while they slept or were otherwise vulnerable. He could then claw open a door or window, and drag the body away to be partially consumed by scavengers, thus disguising them as victims of animal attacks. After masking his crimes in this way several times, he silently but heartily laughed to see a bounty on a dangerous, large desert cat be issued. Perhaps he would hunt one of the carrion-fatted wildcats that prowled beneath Ireth’s walls and try to claim the reward. Or perhaps not. The bounty on the killer beast was a puny sum compared to another contracted killing at the behest of some foreign merchant or local would-be immortal. \r\n\r\nTime passed, until Akemtum embarked on a mission he thought was simple, to eliminate an aggravating junk-sifter scavenging in a scrapyard claimed by Akemtum’s client. Akemtum was creeping through the sump when a pink, hairless cat emerged from the heaps of refuse, hissing and yowling. The noise attracted another salvager to the scene, who chased off the cat. Lest his crime be witnessed, Akemtum hid, fuming, among the rusty filth and waited for the bystander to leave. When he finally did, Akemtum caught up with his target and saw again the noisy cat, this time clutched in the feeble scrap-monger’s arms. Contemptuously, Akemtum ripped his iron claws through both Human and animal, and sealed the fate of the cat, the man, and himself. \r\n\r\nAlone in the junkyard standing over the cooling corpses, Akemtum was assailed by the dark and vengeful spirit of the cat he had killed. He fell to his knees and hallucinated, the rubbish around him distorting in size to become fearsome hills and mountains. Then he saw a great cat, whose soul was the hairless sphynx he had just gutted but whose form was that of the true man-killing beast of prey that he had been falsely imitating. It said that for living by the ways of the beast he would be judged and punished by the revenant spirit of primal beastliness that all Skinwalkers have touched in some form.\r\n\r\nAkemtum lives on, but no longer in the slums. Exiled by popular outcry to the wasteland of ruined buildings closer to the dense and odious center of fell Ireth than wholesome folk dare, he still wields claws to ply the trade of assassin, which drip with the rot of Ireth, promising death to those marked for him and all others who stand against him. His fractured mind yearns to hunt and kill, and his new hybrid feline form has rendered him all the more capable of doing so.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7680#static": "The Fae of the Mistwood care not for bloodlines or legacies. To them they are all the forest’s children and the forest loves them equally, and it merely grants some more power than others.\r\n\r\nWhen a cocoon appeared on a branch of the Heart Tree, the Sylvan knew it would bear a Fae destined to protect and care for the forest. For a century, the Heart Tree fed the cocoon love and compassion, and on the final day of its hundredth year, a Faerie with glowing pearlescent wings, who radiated with power, broke out from it. With the fairest of hearts and unending love, the Fae named her Oella and queen of their court.\r\n\r\nSeason after season, Oella was a guiding example to the Fae folk and she led and loved all with patience and understanding. After Siroth’s darkness spread through the land, none wept as much as Oella for the forest’s suffering. Though not a warrior, she worked tirelessly to aid those fighting back the corruption, healing wounds and curing maladies, and offering them all her warmest encouragement. There seemed little she could do to displease her people, until the time she came to the city of Nyresa in the company of a Dark Elf.\r\n\r\nOella had heard of the Dark Elf known as Ultan when Sylvan Watchers warned her of a trespasser on the forest’s border. Instead of chasing him from the land, Oella secretly met with the stranger on many occasions. At first sensibly cautious but also curious about the Dark Elf’s gentle ways and dreamer’s eyes, that were uncommon among his kin, Oella subtly teased out Ultan’s wants and desires, and judged his character. When all he ever wished for was to find a bountiful land bathed in sunlight, where the people laughed and the land sang back, Oella’s curiosity turned to trust and the unlikely pair harbored a deep friendship.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sylvan saw this outsider strolling around Nyresa at their queen’s side, they demanded he be imprisoned, but Oella claimed that Ultan loved the Mistwood as much as any Sylvan and that he would defend its beauty with his life. As a final stroke to end her people’s arguing, she inducted Ultan into the Fae Court and dubbed him an honorary citizen. Though her people resented her decision, they respected her enough not to openly oppose it.\r\n\r\nDecades passed and Ultan proved himself a worthy companion, confidant, and bodyguard to Oella, but she knew her people did not accept him as one of their own. Though it pained her, she did not rebuke her people’s coldness, believing that Ultan might one day yet gain their acceptance. She never wished he would need to overcome as terrible dangers as he did to achieve it.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by her handmaidens one morn, Oella and Ultan set out on a mission to purify the Great Grove, which had been long lost to corruption. Upon arrival, they were assaulted by a host of corrupted warriors. Had it not been for Ultan’s courage and skill with a blade, all of them would have been killed.\r\n\r\nHaving suffered fatal wounds, Ultan fell after he slew the last of their attackers. Safe but distraught, Oella held Ultan’s body and proclaimed her love. She poured her magic into his wounds, into his very spirit, in a desperate attempt to return him from the brink of death. Pushing her powers to unknown limits and relying on instinct more than age-acquired knowledge, she felt something tug at her heart and she offered it all the power it sought, sealing her miraculous spell. Ultan’s soul was bound to hers. For as long as she drew breath, so too would Ultan.\r\n\r\nThey returned to Nyresa and Oella was so overjoyed that she named Ultan her consort to rule beside her until the end of their days. When news spread of Ultan’s heroic act, the Fae finally showed him a modicum of respect and no longer ignored him as though he were a problem that would go away with time.\r\n\r\nThe queen and consort’s love only grew stronger as they ruled and protected their people together. Yet once the initial euphoria of their miracle settled, Oella began to sense cracks in Ultan’s strength and mind, and in her own. His heart did not beat and she realized her strength was shared between them both.\r\n\r\nFearing that her people would revert to their dislike of her beloved should they notice how his existence weakened her, and what Ultan might do should he discover the truth, Oella has scoured the Mistwood and the Rhythm for a way to rejuvenate herself. Should she discover one, there is no telling what it might be, and what price she might have to pay to use it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7690#static": "Few in Teleria consider the Dark Elves of Durham Forest to be a kind and compassionate folk, and even fewer would welcome a Dark Elf into their midst. It is no surprise, therefore, that people are cautious of even those who prove themselves to be an exception among their cruel kind. Such are the reactions Ultan of the Shell has come to accept and bear without judgment.\r\n\r\nRaised a warrior in Durham Forest, it was evident that Ultan would outgrow the harsh ways of his people. He did not possess the stomach for senseless violence and saw no honor in beating exhausted slaves. Where his siblings gave no thought to their dwellings, Ultan dreamed of a land graced by the sun and free from gloom. As he matured, he realized that it was not a dream that could become reality in Durham.\r\n\r\nLeaving his home, Ultan wandered the world. Receiving only contempt and distrust from the other races, he journeyed to the farthest reaches of the land and found a forest so beautiful it was worth suffering abuse from its population just to gaze upon it. It was none other than the Mistwood. Daring not to offend its guardians, he only explored the woods by day while he would be easiest to track, and wandered no further than the outskirts. Under the eyes of the Sylvan Watchers, he admired the blossoms, trees, and abundant wildlife, his sword always sheathed.\r\n\r\nOne day, Ultan came across one of the most splendid delights of the Mistwood he had yet seen. In a clearing of blooming flowers alighted a woman with glimmering wings. Unlike the other Sylvan, she did not hiss threats at Ultan but welcomed him to sit in her grove.\r\n\r\nThe lady asked him what he dreamt of and Ultan described his fancied lands of wonder. Amused by his answer, the Fae granted him a wish. All he asked was that she tell him her name. It was Oella of the Fae. Much to her surprise, Ultan returned her favor and said she could make a request of him. She implored him to visit her grove again.\r\n\r\nWith their every encounter came a new pair of wishes. Ultan asked to learn of the Mistwood and the Sylvan, but Oella’s request always remained the same: to see Ultan again. As they lay side by side in her bed of flowers, Oella told Ultan about the spirits of the woods, of the sweet fruits Elves could eat, and of the Rhythm that connected all beings of the forest. One day Ultan asked to see her city. Having fostered a great trust for the Dark Elf, Oella accepted his request and led him to Nyresa.\r\n\r\nThe Fae there regarded Ultan with hostility but Oella demanded an end to their protests and revealed herself to Ultan as a queen among her people, and appointed him Lord of Admiration. Unsure of the true meaning behind his title, Ultan nonetheless took it as his duty to admire every sight the Mistwood had to offer and bless every tree, spirit, and rivulet with his utmost respect and gratitude.\r\n\r\nYears passed and Ultan became one of Oella’s most beloved companions, often accompanying her and acting as a bodyguard during her travels. During one excursion, Ultan’s skill and dedication were tested to breaking point.\r\n\r\nOella, Ultan, and her handmaidens journeyed to the remains of the Great Grove, the seat of the lost sacred Heart Tree, to rid it of its malice. But an ambush lay in wait. Sylvan long lost to the corruption attacked from all sides and Ultan met every blade to protect his queen and her entourage. He fought past exhaustion, severing his foes’ tendons and piercing hearts, all while being cut and stabbed in turn. After vanquishing the last threat, his blood poured from a dozen wounds and the last thing he remembered was his head striking the hard earth before everything went black.\r\n\r\nUltan awoke in Nyresa, Oella’s hand in his, and his mind entangled in hers. Through an act of true love, his queen had saved his life by binding their souls. Oella’s heartbeat was his, and through her he heard the Rhythm and felt a connection to the Mistwood. The same day, Oella named him her consort.\r\n\r\nThe Fae respect Oella’s decision, and Ultan’s selfless act has gained him some acceptance from the Sylvan. He has vowed to serve the Mistwood at Oella’s side as a sentinel and vowed to prove that the Sylvans’ hard-earned trust is well placed.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7700#static": "Scarred by the War of the Elves and their banishment to Durham Forest, the Dark Elves have built their culture around isolationism, violence, and survival of the fittest. Backstabbing and betrayal are the norm, and rampant murder is kept in check only by the knowledge that, if an individual gains too much power, they are making themselves a target.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, a ‘hero’ to the Dark Elves is an Elf who displays above all cunning, ruthlessness, and awareness of the machinations of those both above and below them in their fraught social hierarchy. And yet, there is one figure in the mythology of the Dark Elves who rises above the wicked reputation of his kind. He assumes the mantle of one destined not only to survive, but to thrive, heal and, ultimately, reunite.\r\n\r\nThat figure is often known as the Champion, the Scholar, or the Mage. His origins vary depending on who is telling the story. To the nobles of Durham, the Mage is one of their own, a learned academic, often a pupil of a great Dark Elf sorcerer. Among the downtrodden common folk of Durham, he is a humble mushroom farmer or bitterfruit picker who stumbles across an arcane text, and is taken under the wing of a mage who sees his potential.\r\n\r\nRegardless of where he comes from, the Mage is inevitably betrayed by his master, but survives the attempted assassination. In all other Dark Elf stories, this would be where he takes his revenge. Not so with the Mage. With his treacherous master at his mercy, he chooses the unheard-of path, that of forgiveness, perhaps seeking to break the cycle of mistrust and betrayal that so infects Dark Elf society. He allows his former master to live, demanding only their sorcerous staff, the Black Rod, and so secures his reputation as being unlike any other in Dark Elf society.\r\n\r\nSo begins the long road to redemption, not for the Mage, but for all Dark Elves. His studies and his experiences further increase his belief that the nature of Dark Elf culture is inherently twisted, an understanding that seems driven in part by the knowledge and foresight of a higher power. His attempts at reform win him precious few allies, and many enemies. He must constantly defend himself from assassins and the manipulation of his peers, who view his ever-growing magical abilities as a tool for their own supremacy. The Black Rod especially is a double-edged weapon, for while it grants the Mage great power, its whispers are also corrupting, ever-seeking to twist his nobility to something more base and self-serving.\r\n\r\nTales abound of the Mage’s exploits, from banishing the dreaded shadowblade sprite-monstrosity that haunts Durham’s canopy to striking down the murderous Three-Eyed Assassins of the Razor Leaf Sisterhood. Ultimately though, his goal is not just to bring together the many squabbling nobles of Durham Forest, or to lead the downtrodden serfs to freedom. Instead, he wishes to end the rift between High and Dark Elves, and finally bring about unity and peace between them. In his vision, the Dark Elves can leave the shadowed boughs and toxic fauna of the deep, dark Durham Forest behind, and step once more into the light. The Elves of Anhelt can rebuild their society. There will be no more murdering or power struggles, no more serfdom or destitution. Nourishing food, clean air, sunlight, and plentiful land will be the rights of all.\r\n\r\nIn this quest, the Mage is said to be one of four beings fated to save not only their own people, but all of Teleria. In particular, he builds a close bond with one, a High Elf of Aravia. Similarly selfless and wise, the two become allies in the struggle to end ancient enmities and, ultimately, unite the Elves before a final, cataclysmic battle between the forces of Darkness and Light, one that will decide the fate of all Teleria. \r\n\r\nMany Dark Elves scoff at this fanciful story. In times of quiet contemplation, however, when they are alone with their thoughts, it is a bitter Dark Elf indeed who does not privately, silently hope that the tale one day does come to pass. Many want to end their exile, escape the vicious life in Durham, and cease the bloodshed, though they fear to appear weak by voicing such desires aloud. Despite this, some are claiming that there is one particular Dark Elf who fits the descriptions associated with the Mage, a scholar named Kael. If he is indeed the one prophesied to come, the stories of the Mage will surely redouble, lingering deep in hearts that have not quite grown too cold to feel.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7710#static": "Ever since the disaster of the Gaellen War, the Orcs as a people have struggled due to the mistrust and aggression of their neighbors. Despised as overly militaristic, and forced to eke out a desperate living in the harshest parts of Teleria, there seems little hope of unity, progress, or even simple peace for them.\r\n\r\nFor myriad Orcs, this is no great concern. War may have broken their society as a whole, but it also provides the only stable form of employment for many, and gives a reason to others, especially the humans of Anhelt, to view them as allies or mercenaries rather than a threat deserving of extermination. Most do not pause to consider how the cycle of violence, where an Orc takes up arms out of necessity, but is then dragged by reputation into further aggression, has trapped their kind into these warlike ways, leaving them with no choice other than to fight, whether for themselves, for those able to pay, but rarely ever for each other. Most are too busy trying to survive day to day to consider bigger questions, greater challenges, and how they may be overcome. There are some, however, who speak of a time past when their people were renowned for many talents besides their skill as warriors, and when they speak hopefully of that time coming once again, it often involves the arrival of a figure referred to, in different Orcish dialects, as the Champion.\r\n\r\nExactly where the Champion will rise is not known. The priests and shamans of the clans of Peltas usually describe him as the son of a chieftain from the Sorrowlakes. Despite being born into a particularly warlike tribe that seeks redress for losses during the Red Crusade and Gaellen War, the Champion himself is only a reluctant warrior. The Orcs of Anhelt, however, claim that the coming Champion will be a mercenary hero who first took up arms to defend himself from the aggression of those who saw him only as a brute warrior. Betrayed by his employers and abandoned among his slaughtered kin, he launches a relentless hunt for the one who wronged him, which culminates in him taking his revenge and afterwards swearing that other Orcs will never again have to suffer the ignominy of serving treacherous Banner Lords for nothing but the promise of poor coins. Some have come forth to claim these stories apply to them, though only one bears a true likeness to many of the tales. His name is Galek, scion of an aggressive tribe who nevertheless prizes introspection and patience, an Orc who only turns to the ways of the warrior when he has no other choice.\r\n\r\nRegardless of his exact origins, the Orcs agree that, once the Champion realizes his purpose, he will strive to bring unity to his people, no matter how widely they have been scattered. In doing so he will have to overcome first the reluctance and mistrust of his fellow Orcs, then the wrath of the great powers of Teleria when they realize the potential threat posed by unity among Orc-kind. There will be a great battle, perhaps even a great war, but at the end of it all, the Champion will stand triumphant, and his people will be free to live in peace, unshackled from a lifetime of warfare.\r\n\r\nBesides these characteristics, the only aspect that unites fireside stories about the Champion involve his weapons, two hand-axes, Split and Sunder, said to have been reforged from a single, mighty, twin-headed ax that once belonged to a legendary Orc warrior who resisted the Sacred Order and its Red Crusade. The ax was broken in half as the warrior died in battle while buying his clan the time they needed to make their escape. The two halves were recovered and re-forged into two distinct weapons, but how the Champion comes by them is the subject of innumerable tales in itself. Suffice to say, the wickedly sharp heads will once again be wielded in the defense of their people, so the stories tell.\r\n\r\nAccording to some, the Champion will not battle alone, or only for Orc-kind, but will form an alliance with three others, a Dark Elf of Durham, a High Elf of Aravia and a Human knight of the Sacred Order, each paragons of their respective peoples. Then, and only then, a final confrontation will begin between the forces of Light and Darkness, one that will decide the Teleria's fate. In playing their part in it, the Orcs will do what some believe they were always destined to do, and win freedom not just for their people but for the world. Perhaps then, at last, all Orcs will be able to reclaim their ancient heritage, and experience Teleria to the fullest, free from the blights of oppression, violence, and war.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7720#static": "Of all the peoples, nations, and factions across the length and breadth of Teleria, it could be claimed that few argue so vociferously, nor yearn more achingly, for the intervention of the divine than the Sacred Order. From their bastion called the Eternal Citadel in western Anhelt, the adherents of the Order sally forth not only to spread Lumaya’s light, but to carry out what they are convinced is the goddess’ will. Some claim, too, that in doing so they are preparing the way for the return of either the goddess herself, or her chosen champion, from the divine realms beyond the mortal plane.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Order spreads claims about the coming of a hero of the Light with particular vigor, for in such desperate times everyone needs something to hope for. Accounts about just how this hero will materialize vary upon the teller, but there are a number of points the majority share. Like most members of the Sacred Order, the promised one is Human, and usually a woman. Some hold that she has humble origins, others that she is the child of a king or count, but either way, she is normally orphaned, and brought up by the kindness and largesse of the Order. Inculcated with an appreciation of the divine and a desire to uphold the righteous and defend the weak, she undertakes a quest that may or may not be guided by visions of blinding, prophetic light.\r\n\r\nDuring her quest, the hero proves herself to be the chosen one by seeking out and attaining four holy relics, each said to be imbued with Lumaya’s deep, inner light. Invariably, these four relics go by many different names, but all share the characteristics of a spear, a sword, a shield and a suit of plate armor.\r\n\r\nThe spear, often called the Lance of Lumaya, is said to have been wielded against Siroth himself, and once pierced the God of Shadow, dealing him a wound that still pains him to this day. The sword, called the Blade of Righteousness or the Sword of Light, is claimed to be the chief weapon of one of the founding members of the Order. Both sword and spear are believed to be inimical to all creatures of Darkness, and are said to become wreathed in holy, purifying flame when battle against the servants of Siroth is joined.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, both the shield – commonly known as the Shield of the Righteous – and the heavy armor – the Cuirass of Faith – provide not just the regular protection of tempered steel and stout, iron-sheathed oak, but are also inscribed and imbued with prayers to Lumaya that provide defense against the curses and ensorcelled blades of Siroth’s minions in equal measure.\r\n\r\nOnce the hero has collected all of these items, so the stories go, Lumaya will visit them and provide a final benediction that allows them to transcend the bonds of mortality, elevating them into a being that is only a little short of becoming an avatar of the Goddess of Light. Then, with this last blessing, the hero will embark upon the greatest of all crusades, rallying all of the righteous to her banner and waging war on Siroth until the Shadow God himself is destroyed, and Light reigns forever.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat ironic that, while such stories prove to be an evergreen source of hope and inspiration for the common folk, among the higher echelons of the Sacred Order, they are viewed by some with mistrust and even outright hostility. Senior members are willing to keep the stories alive, but are careful to do their utmost to quash any hint that they are coming true, for while the Order continues to promote itself as the one true bastion of faith in Lumaya, those in positions of power know that their holy institution has fallen far from its halcyon days. Some are quite happy with the current circumstances, and would likely decry as a heretic any young upstart who tried to upset the balance of power in Anhelt by claiming to be a warrior-prophetess sent by a higher power. Certainly, rumors that there is already a young knight within the Order, named Athel, who fits many of the characteristics of the hero, have been quickly quashed by some of the upper hierarchy. If – or when – the hero of legend emerges, they may find themselves battling as many enemies within the Sacred Order as without it.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7730#static": "More so than any other event, the War of the Elves and the ensuing schism between those who became the High Elves and the Dark Elves has left a lasting scar on the psyche of the kingdom of Aravia. From the court of the monarch to the most humble crafter, weaver or stall-seller, all High Elves have an opinion on the civil war that split and decimated their race. Usually, these views range from rabble-rousing hatred towards Dark Elves forswearing any contact with them at all, to a desire to lay the old divisions aside for good. Those with the lattermost view – a decidedly minority one in Aravia – usually only hold out slender hope of even the most tentative reunification between the two sides, and yet, their hope persists.\r\n\r\nThe hope is perhaps at its most potent in story form, especially when it concerns a being known as ‘the Champion.’ A recurring legend among Elves in Aravia and beyond, its specifics may change, but its overarching themes remain the same. The Champion goes by many different names and titles, but when the story is told, it is invariably about an Elf woman, usually of noble lineage, armed with a bow and a conviction that she is fighting for the forces of righteousness.\r\n\r\nWhile peace and reunification are the bedrock of the tales about this coming hero, their martial aspects are also frequently touched on. She is described as preternaturally skilled with her bow, able to strike the smallest of targets over and over at distances even other Elves would struggle to discern with the naked eye. The bow itself is subject to all manner of legends. Some claim it was the first and last weapon forged by the semi-mythic Elven smith-king Dornaroc, others that it was crafted out of the pure light of Lumaya herself. In some accounts it is a gift from a Lightbringer hero, in others the tool of a humble Elven huntsman that has been passed down through his family since the dawn of time. Regardless of its provenance, the Champion wields it with breath-taking skill.\r\n\r\nStories of the Champion’s daring, of her battles against the forces of darkness, of her endeavors to vanquish the evils of Siroth and the corruption that besets Teleria, abound. Of greater interest to those who would end the terrible schism that yet splits Elf-kind are the accounts that delve beyond heroic battles and virtuous quests. In many stories, the Champion is not only a peerless warrior, but also a learned scholar. Groomed for a position of power by her noble family, she has a keen intellect that marks her out as a future leader, not just for Aravia, but for Elves all across Teleria.\r\n\r\nIn these particular accounts, the Champion is one of a quartet, a group often known as the Chosen Four. Not all are High Elves, however – in fact, one is the Champion’s shadowy opposite, a Dark Elf male with sorcerous talents and an equal penchant for scholarly study. While some stories have them as only reluctant allies, others show how a cautious reserve around each other gives way to mutual respect and, in some cases, more. It is these tales that see the pair working together to mend the ancient rift between High and Dark Elves, ushering in a new age where the schism is no more.\r\n\r\nOf course, these are all mere stories. No Elf who cares about their reputation would put public stock in claims that a hero will one day emerge and lead the Elves to a new period of unity and harmony. And yet, the tales persist. Some Elves, more taken with stories and prophecies, even look for connections between the Champion and figures currently residing in Aravia. There are rumors, stirred up by unknown gossipers, that Elhain, niece of Queen Eva, suits the Champion’s characteristics. She is, after all, not only a skilled warrior – especially with her favored weapon, the bow – but also a studious scholar. Certainly the Aravian court will not tolerate such idle gossip relating to such an important individual, as the idea that Elhain may one day make peace with the Dark Elves, and even reunite them with the High Elves is unpopular with some. Quite what Elhain herself thinks of the stories is, for now, unknown.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7790#static": "Thief, soldier, athlete, gladiator, champion, lord – in Quintus’ young life, he has been them all. The commonalities between his numerous misadventures and exploits are displays of his dogged determination and skill in battle. His rise has been meteoric and many predict he is due for a fall from glory, but for now, the legend of Quintus the Triumphant is going strong.\r\n\r\nIn childhood, Quintus was an orphan on the streets of Tilshire in eastern Anhelt. Scrounging discarded scraps, begging, waiting in bread doles run by the Church, he endured the glares of the well-to-do who regarded him with pity, disgust, or outright hatred. When he was old enough to possess sufficient strength and dexterity, he turned to thievery. Scaling walls and fences, bashing his way through locked doors, fleeing across rooftops and through maze-like alleys, and occasionally brawling with the authorities, all built up his physique and resilience in ways that would serve him well in the future. After being jailed several times, he was finally banished from Tilshire and the surrounding patrimony. \r\n\r\nQuintus wandered north and arrived at Felwin’s Gate, entrance to the High Elf kingdom of Aravia. There he was questioned and his criminal past was revealed, and the Elven authorities ruled that he could only receive asylum if he joined their foreign auxiliary corps. Filled with others from outside Aravia with questionable pasts, the foreign auxiliaries were notorious for their heavy-handed ways, a reflection of the heavy-handed Elven disciplinarians who oversaw them. With lash and brand, the Elves beat Quintus into an acceptable soldier, and sent him to brutally suppress various border skirmishes and bandit incursions. He reckoned his new life scarcely better than his old.\r\n\r\nOn a rare occasion when his overlords permitted him leave, Quintus traveled to Aravia, the capital city that shared its country’s name, while it was celebrating the quadrennial tournament known as the Aravian Ludothon, in which vast crowds watched competitors take part in dozens of sports and challenges. Dazzled by the glory to be won, Quintus signed himself up for as many events as he could, without consulting his superiors. He competed in hurling the discus and javelin, climbing and leaping, foot races and wrestling, and several forms of combat sports. Thanks to his hard and physically-demanding life, he was outstanding at them all. When his Elf handlers finally tracked him down after he failed to report back in time, they found him being laden with medallions of honor. Quintus was an overnight sensation and new crowd favorite. \r\n\r\nThe calculating Aravians decided that, rather than punish Quintus for his insubordination, they would exploit him differently. He was removed from military service and shipped across the seas to the place that even the haughty Elves admit is the premiere venue in Teleria for gladiators: the Arena City of Velyzar. There he was to compete in the spectacular blood-sports performed year-round, wearing the colors of Aravia and representing their national glory on this stage. \r\n\r\nQuintus, used to being shunted from land to land and role to role, had no problem adapting. Soon, wielding a buckler, dual war hammers and clad in heavy armor, he was winning battles and building on his fame from the Ludothon. He proved so successful that he came to be called the Triumphant, and accumulated a fortune in prize money that his distant Aravian masters could not control. He also found common ground with another Elf-sponsored Velyzar gladiator who broke free from his handler, the Skinwalker called Samson. Samson and Quintus formed a personal friendship, though in the arenas they maintained a façade of being rivals, the better to sell their performances. \r\n\r\nBut even this was not the end of Quintus’ journeys. Having been tossed about on the tempestuous waves of fate for so long, Quintus longed for stability, a place to put down roots, and a source of wealth and power besides fighting. When he felt ready, he announced his retirement from the arena without telling his masters and left once again for Anhelt, where he took up residence in Kaerok. There, he spent a considerable amount of his time, money, and influence convincing a certain duke to sponsor him as a vassal and grant him a small plot of land. Aravian agents soon found out, but they were too late to stop Quintus without risking an international scandal. He had bought himself a noble title, and now was a bona fide Banner Lord. Though he is scorned by other Lords with more distinguished pedigrees, Quintus remains defiant. Is this is merely another stop on Quintus’s convoluted journey through life, however, or if he will finally be able to settle down? Time may tell.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7830#static": "Claidna’s tale begins with a lone pinecone that fell from its branch into the nest of a thrush. Rather than push it from its nest, the small bird kept it among its eggs and sheltered it day and night. When the eggs hatched, so too did the pinecone. Its wooden scales opened to reveal a Fae with bristled wings and skin to match the vessel of her birth. The Rhythm sang her name to her: Claidna.\r\n\r\nThough Claidna could fly from birth, she did not leave the nest and the bird that had nursed her, and remained with them well after she outgrew the other hatchlings. When she could no longer fit in the nest, she took to sitting on the tree’s branches, and as she became more confident she explored the surrounding pines and the forest floor. Seasons later, Claidna reached her full size and with a few gentle notes and caresses wove herself a home at the foot of the tree, so she could still hear and learn the songs of the birds she called family.\r\n\r\nLater, following the Rhythm’s guiding tune, Claidna met other Fae and shared with them the beautiful songs the birds sang. Stories of the new Fae that lived a quaint life with the birds spread and more and more Sylvan journeyed to her part of the Mistwood to hear her songs and feel her touch, including an Elf who had once been a warrior but whose wounds had forced him to retire his sword. When he listened to Claidna’s song, the pain of his old wounds faded and the scars vanished from his skin. Not two moons later, another Elf, this one suffering from prolonged sickness, arrived at Claidna’s home and asked for a song, and was healed. One came with a dying flower which, with but a touch, Claidna restored to full bloom. Soon, Sylvan came every day to ask Claidna to cure their ills and mend their injuries. One of these was a Fae so beautiful of heart and body, with curled, ivory horns that reflected the sunlight in dazzling ways, that Claidna fell hopelessly in love with them, and decided to finally fly the nest and follow them to the great Sylvan city of Nyresa.\r\n\r\nClaidna settled with her partner, and her healing chants granted her the title Lady of Birdsong among the Fae folk. But she could not get accustomed to life in the city. Though built from nature, the city housed thousands of minds all linked to the same Rhythm, and its song Claidna had once found soothing and enchanting now banged deafeningly in her head.\r\n\r\nIn the city, the number of Sylvan needing her powers seemed endless, and with every ailment she cured, the more her voice rubbed raw in her throat and the more empty she felt. Every song took a sip of her power, slowly draining her over time. She longed for her old home and the comfort of her birds, to hear them sing to her, but her partner cherished the comforts of civilization too much to leave the city.\r\n\r\nWhen Claidna could stand Nyresa’s noise no longer, she left in the night, her lover still asleep. The moment she left the city’s boundary, her mind calmed as if she was finally resting after an arduous sprint, despite the ache she felt in her heart for leaving her beloved behind. It had been like cutting off a limb to save herself from a trap, a sacrifice necessary for her greater wellbeing.\r\n\r\nShe returned to her house under the tree and discovered a new brood of birds roosting in the nest and learned the sad news of her family’s departure from this world. Despite the avians’ different bloodline, these birds sang the same songs of Claidna’s family and they welcomed her like an old friend. Bereft yet hopeful for the forging of new relationships, it seemed her life would return to normal.\r\n\r\nBut Claidna was not aware that timber-thieves from the outside world had moved into her pine groves during her absence, nor did she know that her beloved was coming to beg her to return to Nyresa. The two parties found each other first, and Claidna stumbled upon the remains of her dearest Fae and followed a trail of blood to the Humans who had killed them and taken their horns as a trophy.\r\n\r\nClaidna tore the Humans apart with tooth and claw.\r\n\r\nThe Sylvan say the Lady of Birdsong is a lonely spirit who surrounds herself with feathered friends to replace the flock the long-lived Fae had outlived, and that she never speaks to the Sylvan, for she fears she may once again become too attached to someone she dare not lose, or lose her voice to endless demands. Humans, however, speak in hushed tones of a soft voiced creature of pine that slaughters any who wander too deep into the Mistwood.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7850#static": "In the land of Yakai, there are many mythological traits and properties associated with rabbits and hares. They are seen as bearers of good fortune and their rapid breeding makes them symbols of fecundity. Various heavenly bodies are associated with them, with innumerable tales saying they came to Teleria from putative stars, planets, or constellations high in the sky. In other lands hares are bred or hunted for meat and fur as a matter of course, but in Yakai there are more cultural practices and rituals associated with tracking, trapping, and killing them. Since they are regarded as good luck, it is customary for Yakai hunters and furriers to pay a symbolic ‘hare-price’ in exchange for taking the life of one. This price usually consists of a handful of grains or some vegetables, left where hares are known to frequent. Besides functioning as a spiritual ritual, feeding the creatures helps ensure their population remains robust enough for other hunters to profit from it.\r\n\r\nRaas Zal’far was a Human from Anhelt who settled in the foothills of the Cloudspire Mountains on the border of Yakai. A hunter and trapper, he scoffed when he learned of the local customs and superstitions. Paying no mind to the traditional hare-price, he killed as he pleased, despite the protestations of the locals. But those who slay animals for their living are at particular risk of contracting the Skinwalker curse, and those who take more than their fair share are all the more at risk, for they are rolling the dice of fate all the more frequently. \r\n\r\nOne day this fate befell Raas Zal’far as he was butchering his catch, and a violent hare spirit, contorted by the touch of Darkness, attacked his soul. Rich fur such as that he had long profited from sprouted across his skin, his ears grew skyward like stalks of corn, and his body and musculature distorted painfully. Raas’s mind and spirit struggled mightily with the hare-essence, and this transitory period of mental and physical anguish lasted far longer than is typical for a newly-afflicted Skinwalker. For weeks he rampaged through the woods babbling and shrieking, striking fear into the local people. Stories spread of the rampaging, insane beast-man, and the constant repetition of his name eventually transmuted it into Razelvarg. \r\n\r\nThough his violent struggle to integrate his beast-self eventually ended, Raas’ mind was twisted and scarred, leaving him a vicious lunatic. He attacked farms and feasted on their crops, needing vast amounts of plant matter to sustain his huge, swift, and robust body. He first killed individual farmers, and then preyed on armed groups who assembled to deal with him. From his early victories he scrounged a pair of swords, and when a wolf tried to hunt him he slaughtered it and now wears its skin triumphantly. Survivors of his attacks described, shuddering, his incredibly swift leaps and bounds, and seeing a furry blur out of the corner of their eye zipping from tree to tree and cover to cover. They said slingers and archers were too slow to aim and track the creature, and one by one stout swordsmen and club-bearing militiamen were pounced upon and were slashed to ribbons or had their throats torn out. \r\n\r\nAfter multiple failed attempts to kill the creature, the local magistrate put a massive bounty on Razelvarg's head and issued a call to arms. It was more successful than anticipated: sorcerers, priests, men-at-arms, gladiators from Velyzar, and Dwarves from the Skyiron Dominion traveled to the region, lured by the promise of reward, a sense of moral duty, or both. Many members of this impromptu crusade, especially those from Yakai, proclaimed they were furious at Razelvarg for besmirching the folklore of their people. \r\n\r\nDespite their shared goal, and in some cases zeal and hatred, these bounty hunters have been reluctant to cooperate with each other, loath to split the prize and mistrustful of potential allies. Thus, Razelvarg remains at large, and scattered incursions into his territory by the more bold or foolhardy seekers have ended either with no sighting of the creature, humiliating failure, or the hunters’ slaughter. All the while, Razelvarg continues to devastate entire fields of crops, and he rips apart any farmer who tries to defend their land from him.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7860#static": "Hundreds of years ago, the Gaellen Pact invaded the Kingdom of Kaerok. It was defeated.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of war and pillage, the Gaellen Pact’s forces were broken on the field of battle, and tens of thousands of Orcs, Ogryn, Lizardmen, and Skinwalkers were scattered throughout the continent of Anhelt. But not all of these Gaellens were warriors. For many of the Gaellen Pact, the invasion of Kaerok was not simply retribution for the Red Crusade, but also a reclamation of what they believed to be their ancestral homelands. Anticipating a glorious victory and the purge of every Human in Anhelt, dozens of Gaellen clans sailed to Kaerok in their entirety, families and children traveling alongside hosts of warriors. When the Gaellen forces were broken, these innocents were exposed to the wrath of the Banner Lords and others, and were forced to flee alongside their routing defenders.\r\n\r\nNone of the Gaellen Pact races suffered that fate as much as the Orcs. Nearly every Orc clan had sailed to Anhelt as part of the invasion, and each clan had to find its own way after the Pact’s defeat. Some managed to negotiate with Banner Lords too weakened by the war to fight them, but most were forced to hide on barren lands or in choking forests. As centuries passed, these isolated clans set about doing what they did best: making do with what they could get. But once the Banner Lords recovered from the Gaellen War, they found even this meager peace intolerable.\r\n\r\nIt was into this world – a world growing ever-smaller as Banner Lord knights raided every Orc clan they could find – that Artak was born.\r\n\r\nArtak was the son of Turan, his clan’s warlord – a title that did not fit the Orc well, as he was famous among the clans as a peacemaker. Despite increasing provocations from the local Kaerok duke, Turan refused to allow any of his warriors to retaliate, instead granting humiliating concessions to the duke’s knights. It earned Turan the nickname ‘Peacelord’, a name which Turan himself laughed off, but which boiled Artak’s blood.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, the duke approached ‘Peacelord’ Turan with an offer: fight alongside the duke’s forces in a dispute against a neighboring Banner Lord, and the duke would recognize some of Turan’s territorial claims near one of his cities. Artak begged his father to refuse, arguing that the duke could not be trusted, but his father was blinded by the promise of a permanent home.\r\n\r\nArtak’s instincts were right. The duke’s forces spent the Orcs' lives cheaply, sending them to the worst of the fighting and to do the dirtiest deeds. The duke won his war, but more than half of Turan’s warriors were killed. Worst of all, when the King of Kaerok came down on the duke for fighting in his own realm, the duke blamed Turan’s clan for instigating the fighting. The duke cast out Turan and his people, breaking his promises and stripping away his land. With his forces depleted, Turan was in no position to resist. Artak was forced to watch his once-proud father wither away to a shadow of who he once was, before the ‘Peacelord’ finally succumbed to illness less than a year after the clan was forced to flee.\r\n\r\nIt was a betrayal that Artak would never forgive. Not long after assuming the title of warlord, Artak sent messengers to every other Orc clan he knew of, calling for a grand gathering – ostensibly an opportunity for trade and competition, but Artak had a far greater hope in mind.\r\n\r\nAlmost every clan agreed to meet, such gatherings had been called before, and they were an ancient tradition. While Artak’s people enjoyed the games and traded with the other clans, the man himself addressed the other collected warlords. He shouted the injustices that his father had suffered, and the uselessness of appeasement – the Banner Lords would take until the Orcs had nothing left at all, as ‘Peacelord’ Turan had been forced to learn. Artak claimed there was no bottom to the greed of Humans. And so he presented an alternative: war. Bloody vengeance, exacted on the entire realm of Kaerok. Not every warlord agreed, but none stood against him, and so he walked away from the gathering with an army of revanchists.\r\n\r\nArtak's army fell upon Kaerok like a plague, slaughtering any who dared to oppose them. The Orcs cut a bloody swathe through the Banner Lords, achieving success after success, and that led to even greater numbers joining them. All Artak's victories – all his righteous anger – only made it more difficult for him to swallow his pride when his son, Galek, dared to push for mercy to be granted to the Humans.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7920#static": "The Warchief and High Commandant of Balar’s Gate on Felwin's Wall, Graazur is a mentor and leader whose acumen gives lie to the myth that all Ogryn are simpleminded brutes. The feats of logistics, discipline, and diplomacy required for him to carry out his duties would wither a lesser leader. \r\n\r\nTo guard the mighty Balar’s Gate and the immense wall that separates Aravia from the rest of Anhelt is, for some Ogryn, the highest calling imaginable. The Ogryn say the Wall was mandated by Lumaya herself, and take all suggestions that it was a geopolitical contrivance rather than divine will to be insultingly blasphemous. They hold to this because they believe they too were given a sacred directive by the Goddess: to maintain and defend it as a force of neutrality between the High Elves and the Dark Elves, and as a symbol of peace for all the world. However, many Ogryn hailing from elsewhere distrust the Wall and scorn its defenders, saying those who serve there are deluded zealots willingly fueling the stereotype of Ogryn as brute servants unable to direct themselves. \r\n\r\nThe truth is probably somewhere in between, a fact that Graazur is keenly aware of. He is no zealot, nor a total cynic, but a realist. He knows that especially for the Ogryn under his command, playing a role in guarding the Wall affords more dignity and respect than they could expect to find elsewhere, but also that Ogryn resent even the implication of being viewed as exploitable labor and can be quick to anger. His daily toils are to liaise between the various commanders serving under him, soothe their occasionally rampaging egos, quell internecine disputes, and enforce the law. Should he fail in these tasks, the whole Gate could erupt into factionalism and anarchy. \r\n\r\nFelwin's Wall, which stretches for hundreds of miles, is akin to a massive, if narrow, fortress-city, and Graazur was raised from birth there to serve it. He grew up amid its warrens and catacombs and great halls, learning much from those who came before him. Ogryn coming from afar – whether they were pilgrims who saw the wall as a sacred place, or seekers of gainful employment – did not have the same perspective as Graazur, who had seen the inner workings of the place and knew many of the less-than-holy aspects of its daily operation. Thus, after long years of service, he was eventually elevated to the position of Warchief and High Commandant, the supreme military authority of the Balar's Gate garrison, for his pragmatism and experience. \r\n\r\nGraazur is called Irongut for his unbreakable constitution. He claims sickness has never touched him and he has never quailed in fear nor turned squeamish even while enduring the most vile and disgusting scenarios. He has shrugged off numerous attempts on his life, carried out by anonymous agents suspected to be employed by Dark Elf agitators seeking to break the unity of the Gate’s defenders. In one oft-repeated tale of intrigue, spies lured Graazur to a fabricated meeting somewhere deep in the labyrinthine corridors that worm their way through and under Felwin's Wall. Finding himself alone against a dozen assassins wielding poisoned blades, he stood his ground and broke them in half, one by one. Though it pushed the limits of even Graazur’s steely determination and remarkable metabolism, he was able to stagger away from the ambush. Healers were rushed to his side, and they worked their spells and poultices as a matter of routine, but he deemed the treatments superfluous. He said dealing with the steady stream of couriers at the Gate, who come on behalf of sundry princes and merchants to request tariff exemptions and writs of passage, tires him vastly more than any life-or-death struggle.\r\n\r\nMore overt attacks on the Gate have also been thwarted by Graazur and not only from malcontent Elves. Monsters regularly wander, or are driven, out of Durham Forest and the foothills of the Redspike Mountains, and Graazur and his elite warriors rarely miss a chance to fight and repel these dangers. Giant beasts, flying horrors, insane Skinwalkers, ferocious Demonspawn, and the eternal scourge of the Undead are just a few of the threats that have broken themselves against the Irongut and the iron gates of Balar.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7930#static": "Today, Jotunn such as Jetni are scattered and isolated in the most frigid and inhospitable depths of the Redspike Mountains, their very existence on the verge of fading into myth. These towering humanoids, long-lived with memories stretching back centuries, recall the great wars and the sacrifices of their people, the old alliances that once bound them to Teleria, and the greatness that was and could still be theirs. Some feel only a sad nostalgia, or actively wish to never repeat their violent history and fade away. But there are a few who refuse to quietly exit the stage of history. \r\n\r\nBecause of their rich memories and preference for solitude, many Jotunn are prone to periods of deep reminiscence and pondering, sometimes spending months on end in physical torpor and mental cogitation. Jetni awoke one day from such a state as though from hibernation, crusted with rime alone on some mountain crag. She felt a rare fire in her icy heart, and decided that she could not let any more time slip away. She wanted to accomplish something great, like her ancestors had. But she had little in the way of worldly experience or moral understanding. Wandering from the peaks to the more inhabited lower foothills and passes, she encountered the people of Frostheim and their villages. As though following the script of a conqueror of old, she demanded tribute and submission.\r\n\r\nAt first she was laughed at, but nonetheless the naïve Jotunn persisted, and from brutal experience she slowly but surely became a skilled fighter and a growing menace to the northernmost Frostheim holds. The strongest of these holds, Crimsonhorn, sent forth its hetman, Alsgor, to parley with Jetni. They agreed to meet on neutral ground, to be witnessed by Alsgor’s men but from a great distance, so the two stood alone surrounded by onlookers. \r\n\r\nAs they circled one another, their weapons yet sheathed but their hands twitching to draw them, Alsgor demanded a justification for her rampages. She led no followers nor hoarded plunder, and so her motives and objectives were opaque to him. Jetni fiercely replied that greatness is never won with meekness, and the proud history of Frostheim was littered with what could rightly be called rampages as well. Glory was her aim, and it required violence. Alsgor spat at her notions. \r\n\r\nJetni rushed toward Alsgor, and his warriors prepared to intervene. Alsgor raised his fist and stopped them in their tracks, and told them to hold. He met Jetni’s massive form head-on. Still neither drew their weapons, but brawled with bare fists and knees and teeth, for some primal sense of honor that neither could explain. Jetni’s size was countered by Alsgor’s dexterity, and he traded blows with her three-for-one, though each hit from the Jotunn was like that of a sledgehammer. \r\n\r\nHis ribs broken and his muscles pulverized, Alsgor cried out to Jetni. He named the civilized glories that he treasured: friends and family, fairness and mercy, the honor of the forefathers, protection of the weak, love of the Goddess and her Light. He swore to Jetni that without these things, war and violence would bring her only shame and ruin. Then, at last, Alsgor could rise no more, laying flat on his back and wheezing to the sky. \r\n\r\nHis retinue dashed toward the scene, no longer willing to abide by his wishes and stand idle, but then Jetni, too, collapsed and could offer no further resistance. Men of Crimsonhorn swarmed her and bound her so securely that even a healthy Jotunn could not have budged, while others tended to their hetman, setting his dislocated limbs and swabbing his bloodied brow. \r\n\r\nToo beaten in body and spirit to resist her captivity, Jetni spoke once again to Alsgor, and they exchanged a few more words before they were both carried off, he to be succored and she to the center of the town to be detained in a huge makeshift cage that was constructed around her. What those words were went unrecorded, but both the man and the giant seemed to brood on them while they both recovered from their respective wounds. \r\n\r\nSix days passed for Alsgor to heal and evidence to be gathered of Jetni’s rampage, and then he presided over her trial. He stunned the assembled crowd by sentencing her to servitude rather than death – she was to repair her damages, labor to pay her debts, and learn right from wrong. Furthermore, since it was his sentence and his potential folly, he declared he would accompany her, and his force of arms would carry out the death penalty if necessary.\r\n\r\nSo began a partnership and a journey of growth that shall perhaps see Jetni redeemed… if Alsgor’s guidance proves true, for he himself is a complex and troubled soul.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7940#static": "Alsgor grew up in the snowy northern hold of Crimsonhorn in the Redspike Mountains. He enjoyed more privilege than most, being a scion of an influential clan, the hetman-apparent, and a handsome, well-loved lad. He was trained in the arts of war and educated in politics, molded from childhood to fit the position of leadership. His life seemed charmed. Behind the affable smile and seemingly-confident words of Alsgor’s public persona, however, he was deeply troubled. Secretly, he felt that his charisma amounted to superficial sophistry and manipulation, not worthy of praise, and that his status was unearned and given to him only through birth and circumstance. He felt his learning was spoon-fed to him in manageable amounts, and stresses carefully doled out to him to test him but never deeply challenge him. Oppressed by the looming obligation of leadership, he spent years fighting the Hold’s enemies and trying to keep it out of his mind. \r\n\r\nWhen his parents were laid to rest and he became the hetman of Crimsonhorn, Alsgor scarcely had time to grieve before being thrust into a world of political maneuvering and ruthless power-mongering, surrounded by flatterers he could not trust nor truly confide in, with the wolves of rival clans and holdfasts at his door as well as the constant menace of monsters, Undead, and natural disaster. Even though it was the role he had been prepared to take for all his life, he found it demanding and unpleasant. While he maintained his façade of a perfect leader, knowing the people expected it of him, in private he lurched from crippling sadness to red fits of rage. Were it not for his meeting with Jetni the Giant, his reign may have ended in a spectacular downfall.\r\n\r\nJetni was a Jotunn bent on making a name for herself bullying outlying settlements on the verges of habitable land. With Crimsonhorn the closest hold of sufficient strength to defeat a rampaging giant, it fell to Alsgor to deal with her. His councilors advised him to assemble a warband, or put a bounty on Jetni’s head so that sellswords would bear the brunt of the inevitable casualties from a clash with the Jotunn. For the first time, Alsgor rejected the words of the wise people his forebears had carefully chosen to advise him out of hand. He did not wish to use the power of a state’s military violence against her, criminal though she was. He decided to parley with Jetni personally, in spite of the immense danger. His courtiers were shocked but could do nothing but placate their liege and agree. \r\n\r\nThe meeting devolved swiftly into a brawl, with both Alsgor and Jetni disdaining their weapons in favor of a more primal duel of fists and feet. Locked in solo combat, heart pounding, Alsgor felt focused and untroubled in a way he had not experienced since becoming hetman. But his training as a statesman still prevailed upon his hard-pressed mind even in combat. As he and Jetni clashed, Alsgor tried to reason with her, and when the tempo of their battle lulled he gasped out a heartfelt argument on the glory of civilization and the folly of blind aggression. Between punches he told her to cultivate friends and family, and a place to love and protect. When she struck him with the force of ten men, he wheezed through his broken ribs that she needed a higher power to faithfully serve and rely on in times of trouble, doubt, and weakness. As he said these things he did not know if he himself believed them, or if he was simply relying on what he knew would be effective rhetoric. Perhaps his speech was meant to persuade himself and the Jotunn alike, a message from his higher self addressing the frightened child within him.\r\n\r\nAlsgor and Jetni fought to a standstill, at which point Alsgor’s honor guard intervened and bound the exhausted giant in massive chains. When Alsgor had recovered from the fight he was asked to render a verdict at Jetni’s trial for the harms she had done to all the outlying settlements of Crimsonhorn and beyond. Most assumed that execution would be the giant’s fate. But, for reasons of his own that might never come to light, Alsgor decreed that Jetni would perform a tour of penitentiary service throughout the lands that she had once terrorized, and onward from there all across Frostheim. He called it a journey of punitive redemption and rehabilitation for the wayward Jotunn, but it was just as equally meant to be a journey of self-reflection and self-discovery for the troubled ruler himself. He had made a righteous speech to her, but could he live up to his own exhortations? If he could not manage to improve the nature of one individual, how could he be fit to rule over the masses?",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7950#static": "No one deeply understands the dream-like magic that suffuses and powers the Fae and their proceedings. Certainty is fundamentally incompatible with study of them. Surely magic is the core of all their ways, so reason scholars. How else could Fae claim dominion over bizarre and eclectic domains such as thunder clouds or lichens, and draw the power to change shape and wreak havoc from absurd sources? Nothing in their eldritch world seems truly impossible, and for ambitious Fae like Criodan, that represented an opportunity.\r\n\r\nLong ago, when the Fae Court was young, an upstart minor noble proclaimed himself Criodan the Blue, Lord of Azure, Master of All The Sapphire-Souled Forces. Even within a Court that buzzes with illogical energy, there seem yet to be patterns, and even in an early form, their politics had norms; but Criodan sought to shatter them and set a new standard. While other Fae were claiming to represent things such as Reeds, Moonlight, Mountaintops, and Cinders, Criodan audaciously presumed a far vaster swath of creation as his domain. Was such a thing even possible? Would his power be vast, or diluted to the point of uselessness? No one knew, and Criodan was determined to find out.\r\n\r\nOther noble Fae reacted with titters, gossip, whispers, and occasional screams. Enough of them genuinely feared Criodan, or at least wished to preserve existing norms, that he faced immediate opposition that grew along with his notoriety. To the Fae, fending off murderous attacks can be just another part of existence, and Criodan was frequently set upon by other lords as well as their agents and creations. Tales say that as he moved from blue to blue he knew no peace: by cerulean pools of pristine water he was attacked by lumbering rock-golems, flying in bird form he was targeted by unnatural lightning from the clear blue sky, and when he retreated to the heart of an ancient glacier, his enemies assailed it with otherworldly heat. \r\n\r\nCriodan, and a small handful of friends and allies, fought back. To combat his foes, Criodan conjured sapphire-hued storms of freezing hail, each chunk hard as iron and with edges sharp as razors, and to his hand he conjured a blade formed of mystic ice and crackling bark. At his command, his allies fought ferociously, with incredible speed and grace. The blessings of the Blue were mysterious and manifold, and those who doubted that Criodan could master such a broad concept were terrified to see that mastery growing with every attack he thwarted. \r\n\r\nThey insisted that Criodan’s scope be narrowed, that he be content styling himself the Marquis of Hail or the Exarch of Freezing Skies. Criodan refused, and continued attracting power and attention to himself. The struggles between his Fae clique and the others saw jungles encased in rime as frost fought with vine, and streams dammed with ice to thwart the machinations of the Duchess of Rushing Water, who battled Criodan for aqueous mastery. \r\n\r\nTheir rivalry proved Criodan’s most dire challenge. The Duchess too possessed a broad domain, but not so expansive as the very concept of ‘the Blue’. Her authority over all that flowed was sufficient to beat Criodan back to stagnant lakes and ponds and the occasional meager patch of blue sky. Then, accounts of Criodan dry up and end, seemingly along with Criodan himself – likely because the many spiritual domains he claimed were absorbed by other Fae who were more willing to specialize. Or perhaps Criodan went into hiding, or bowed to a new master and now wears a new guise.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7960#static": "The Gaellen War was a time of great suffering for many Ogryn. As the conflict played out, it led to the emergence of many factions and belief systems, all seeking to rationalize the bloodshed and secure the survival of the tribes. From the brutal and fatalistic Bone Crushers to the unifying Battle-Summoners, each sought to harness their unique abilities and philosophies. But few matched the levels of arcane channeling achieved by the group known as the Blood Revival.\r\n\r\nOriginally composed of Ogryn shamans drawn from across many different tribes, the Blood Revival’s core tenet was simple – violence was not always destructive, and could be used to serve a greater purpose. The Revival’s shamans had a unique connection to the Ogryn psyche, able to harness the raw energy unleashed by the prodigious aggression Ogryn were capable of, turning it to other ends. In particular, they could trammel destruction into energies that could be used to heal their fellow Ogryn.\r\n\r\nThe skills necessary to utilize such magic were difficult to master, and the Blood Revival remained few in number, but they swiftly proved their usefulness to the Gaellen Pact. Ogryn warriors could drive with impunity into the midst of the enemy, splintering shields, cracking skulls, and carving open torsos in the knowledge that doing so gave their shamans the ability to heal even the most grievous wounds.\r\n\r\nThe original shamans took on apprentices. Foremost among them was Wuzgar, a young Ogryn who had long yearned to join the Revival. Enamored by the stories and rhythms of the Battle-Summoners and burning with hatred inspired by the brutalities of the Red Crusade, he saw the Blood Revival as the key to victory, and his radicalism only increased when many of his tribe were slain during a Telerian League attack. \r\n\r\nWuzgar swiftly became a prominent Revival shaman, attuned like no other to the potential that Ogryn violence carried and the way its energies could be employed to restore and thus continue the bloodshed, creating a vicious cycle of destruction that devastated several Telerian League armies.\r\n\r\nYet despite Wuzgar’s ferocity and the Blood Revival’s efforts, the war continued to turn against the Pact. Wuzgar and his fellow shamans could not be everywhere at once, and as the frequency of losses rose, so the Revival’s own numbers began to dwindle, something Wuzgar recognized as the cycle of defeat. After the death of his mentor, he assumed command of the last of the shamans, intending to lead them in one final effort to halt the ongoing Telerian invasion of Peltas.\r\n\r\nBut death amid the storm of battle was not to be Wuzgar’s fate, at least not immediately. The Arbiter had been watching the efforts of the Blood Revival. She had become intrigued by their ability to heal through violence, and believed such knowledge could be put to use in future wars against Siroth. As the Pact made its last stand, she appeared before Wuzgar and urged him to accept immortality through one of her Shards. Wuzgar refused, determined to perish with his people, but the Arbiter showed him a vision, one where even the bloodshed of the Gaellen War seemed small and petty. Ogryn were slaughtered and enslaved by Demonspawn hordes, in a conflict that set the whole of Teleria alight. The Arbiter assured Wuzgar he had a part to play in such a war if it occurred and, by doing so, his people and their skills would live on.\r\n\r\nWuzgar grudgingly accepted. The Blood Revival would continue, a fact that, with time, even the descendants of the Telerian League peoples might come to be thankful of.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7970#static": "The High Elves of Aravia are known for their haughty self-importance and sense of superiority. Their rulers reign with an inviolable belief in their own worth, and the nobility of the kingdom exemplify all the advantages of privilege and wealth. Even within their ranks, however, there is a hierarchy of authority, and while the monarch sits at the shining pinnacle, a number of other High Elves are barely removed from the heights of royal luster.\r\n\r\nIlysinya is one such powerful noblewoman. She is the matriarch of House Sinya, which for almost a thousand years has been one of the foremost families in High Elf society. She exemplifies every trait to be expected of Aravian nobility, but few would try to claim that her station and success are the mere result of being born into privilege.\r\n\r\nHouse Sinya is a cadet branch of the royal family of Aravia, and a potent force within the Aravian court. It is not been unheard of for there to be friction between the most powerful High Elf families and the reigning monarch down the centuries, but the Sinyas have always worked carefully to maintain a close and trusted position beside the throne, casting themselves as its staunch supporters. Ilysinya continued that tradition, keeping her family in Queen Eva’s good graces and, in turn, ensuring ongoing power and patronage.\r\n\r\nIlysinya is an experienced and masterful courtier, and a leading member of Aravia’s great and good, but she has long proved herself more than a mere aristocrat. In her younger years she served as a lancer in the Royal Whitemanes, a prestigious cavalry regiment in the Aravian army. The ranks of the Whitemanes are traditionally filled by the Aravian nobility, and during her service Ilysinya not only laid the foundation of the many alliances and acquaintances she would later use in court, but gained valuable combat and leadership experience.\r\n\r\nDuring her service, Ilysinya carried with her House Sinya’s most precious and potent heirloom, the Shield of Aravia. An exquisitely-inlaid shield bearing upon it a rendering of Lumaya in her guise as an Elven goddess, it is said to have been given to a scion of the house, Ansinya, by the Arbiter in ages past. It is a symbol not only of the favor that House Sinya is held in, but remains a relic sacred to the whole of Aravia itself, highlighting the kingdom’s supposed ongoing preeminence in the eyes of the Goddess of Light. Indeed, when needed its wielder is able to call upon the shield and its patron, and blinding, brilliant illumination surges forth from its surface, blinding the forces of Darkness. Ilysinya herself has called upon its glory on a number of occasions, turning the tide of battle in favor of the armies of Aravia.\r\n\r\nIndeed, despite her senior position and steadily advancing years, to this very day Ilysinya is not shy of blood and battle, believing that the privileges of high station come with responsibilities that include leading the way in times of war. Following the initiation of King Tayba's War, she has returned to the ranks of the Whitemanes, bearing her lance and shield proudly, and has proven herself each time both a skilled combatant and a shrewd commander. When Ilysinya goes to battle, she does so convinced of victory, firm in her unshakable belief in the superiority of High Elf nobility.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7980#static": "This story is purely fictional.\r\n\r\nIn the remote Zuriban Hills east of the Cloudspire Mountains, there is a temple called the Gadiato, built to contain a mysterious relic from the distant past. A complex construction of stone and brass clockwork, graven with mystic runes, no mortal knew its function. They knew only that it was important, and so monks protected it dearly, until one day its true function would be revealed. Wukong was one such monk, but he was no pious soul. He had such little interest in serving in the Gadiato that to convince him to join, he was awarded the title of 'Sun', or, ‘great sage’. To the rest of the monks, it was a mocking symbol of his arrogance, but Wukong believed his title wholeheartedly. He was given a diadem and staff as badges of his office, and he loudly extolled his own wisdom and virtue.\r\n\r\nOne day, the prideful Sun Wukong was offended by the presence of a firemonkey, whom he believed was stealing from the monastery. When he spotted it, he struck it down with an arrow, even though his faith preached tolerance and kindness to all creatures. It was no ordinary firemonkey however, but a shapeshifting Fae, a trickster spirit from the primordial wilds. The spirit of the dying Fae lashed out and attached itself to the soul of Wukong. A mental and physical struggle ensued, and Wukong was transformed into a simian Skinwalker. Unlike in the case of most Skinwalkers, who largely retain their personality after transforming, the soul of the Fae wormed its way deep into Wukong’s psyche, causing him to acquire its capriciousness and whimsy, and granting him great beastly strength. Worse, the Fae cursed Wukong, binding his gaudy diadem to his flesh so it could not be removed, and binding his body to the Gadiato, so he could never leave. When he realized this, he raged and despaired.\r\n\r\nSun Wukong stewed in his anger, until a mysterious pilgrim arrived and came to him. When they were alone, she cast off her humble robes and revealed a glorious light – it was the Arbiter herself. She told Wukong that she knew of his plight, and that his fate was richly deserved, for he was a blowhard and a hypocrite. Nonetheless, she offered him a chance for redemption: her power was sufficient to nullify the curse, as long as he remained in her presence, allowing him to leave the temple. She proposed he join her on a journey of penitence. Skeptical at the appearance of a legendary immortal, Wukong demanded proof of the Arbiter’s power. In response, she approached the ancient stone relic of the Gadiato. At her touch, its runes glowed and the mechanical device levitated before her. It followed her like a dog on a leash, and she explained that she intended to return the relic to its rightful owners. Convinced, Wukong agreed to serve as the Arbiter’s bodyguard. He was desperate to lift his curse and, on a deeper level, he felt the first inklings that the Arbiter was right and he had to atone for his lifetime of pomposity and vanity.\r\n\r\nTheir journey, through the plains of eastern Peltas, the Mistwood, and across the Cloudspire Mountains, is an epic tale unto itself. Across fields and pastures, hills and forests, lakes and rivers, Sun Wukong protected the Arbiter from Demonspawn, twisted Fae, monstrous creatures, bandits, cutthroats, and natural disasters. He spoke much with her as they traveled and slowly, his nature softened with humility and grace. In turn, she enjoyed his mischievous humor. At last, he realized the error of his ways.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving at a sanctuary in the southern Cloudspires, the Arbiter presented the relic to a consortium of lorekeepers, and at last revealed its purpose: it was an enchanted codex, containing within the wisdom of the ancient builders of the Arbiter’s Tower who aided her in doing Lumaya’s work combatting the Darkness long ago. This revelation contributed greatly to the development of the nascent Nyresan Union.\r\n\r\nAs for Sun Wukong, the Arbiter revealed to him that the journey had been a test – she could have lifted his curse all along. But Wukong did not resent her. Rather, he praised her works and rejected his past sins, and with that, the curse of the diadem was broken. Though it was no longer supernaturally attached, he vowed to wear it forever more, as a reminder to never return to his old ways. The great sage now knew wisdom and journeyed back to the Gadiato, determined to spread his teachings to all who would listen, never letting go of the playfulness that won him the Arbiter's affection.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=7990#static": "Little is known of the Sylvan of the Mistwood, for they rarely leave their highland jungles to consort with the rest of Teleria. Most assume the worst of them for it – that the Sylvan Elves are cruel, haughty, or arrogant, and that they have no interest in the lesser peoples of the world. The truth, however, is different. For them, to be separated from their homeland is to suffer a feeling of isolation that outsiders can scarcely understand. For when they are among their own kind, the Sylvan are in touch with a magic that binds them together, cascading their emotions and sensations to any other Sylvan in reach who cares to listen. They call this magic the Rhythm, and if they leave their home, the lack of it is a deafening silence. And so they rarely leave.\r\n\r\nWithout the Rhythm, most Sylvan have great difficulty communicating with those around them, as they are accustomed to reading the emotions of their interlocutors directly. Which is why, especially in the days before the creation of the Nyresan Union, the Sylvan Elves relied upon specially-trained ambassadors to speak with outsiders. These ambassadors were educated in the ways of facial expressions, inference, deception, and empathy – methods of communication that other Telerians find normal. Such training was difficult to master, however, and it did little to replace the Rhythm for most of the ambassadors who would be leaving their homeland. One of their number, however, proved exceptionally talented… but she would also prove the dangers of consorting with outsiders.\r\n\r\nSaerlaith departed for the great mage-city of Ireth, hoping to attend its legendary Academy. Most Sylvan ambassadors were sent to establish ties of trade or alliances, but Saerlaith had an altogether more important – and more dangerous – mission: she was to use the resources of Ireth to study the nature of the Rhythm itself, hoping that she could find a way to replicate its magic beyond the confines of the Mistwood.\r\n\r\nBut the Sylvan feared that unscrupulous mages could use whatever was discovered against them – the Rhythm had already been turned against the Sylvan Elves and Fae in ages past, when Siroth had corrupted the Heart Tree that produced the magic and used it to control large swathes of the population. If the Sylvan were to investigate this most holy of magics with the aid of Irethi mages, they would have to do so discreetly. In trying to determine who among the Sylvan would be most suitable for this mission, Saerlaith was the first choice. She was coy, adept at magic, and had a narcissistic streak that left her resilient to the crushing depression of living without the Rhythm. She was eager to begin.\r\n\r\nSaerlaith hid her true goals from the powers of Ireth, but the limitation proved more calamitous than expected. Acting with discretion prevented her from piquing the interest of the more academic mages of the academy, who might have been interested in her mission for its own sake. With only her mystique and her origins to inspire others to help her, she was left with only those looking for the prestige of winning the beautiful Sylvan ambassador’s attention – it was not long before she found herself in the path of Arion and Valkanen.\r\n\r\nArion and Valkanen were the most brilliant and promising young mages in all of Ireth, and they hated each other. Exceedingly arrogant, the posturing in their competition to be greatest mage in the academy bordered on unbearable to anyone close to them. When the two men discovered Saerlaith – her talent, her beauty, her influence in the Mistwood – she became the latest and most important object of their contest. This, unfortunately for Saerlaith, also played upon her own vanity. She could not bring herself to discourage either party. She told herself that she was encouraging them in order to further her plans, for they were so powerful. In a way, she told herself, she was still fulfilling her duties to her people – even if she might have enjoyed it more than was proper.\r\n\r\nBut the escalating tension between the three of them refused to plateau. Saerlaith, for all her empathy, misjudged her suitors. She believed they were honorable enough to limit their ambitions. She believed they saw themselves as bound by laws and reason. She believed they would not exchange their humanity for more power. She believed that she was safe.\r\n\r\nShe was wrong.",

Tatsu knelt before her lord. \r\n\r\nDemonic blood and dark magic were pumped into her veins, infusing her blood with incredible strength, arcane power, and unrelenting agony. Her screams echoed throughout the palace, and in the end, it was for nothing: she was mighty, immortal… and blind. She had been too weak for the ritual, her masters said. It left her useless, and they discarded her.\r\n\r\nTatsu spent the next decade working in her warlord’s palace garden, ignored. For a long time, it was torment – only the useful were safe, she thought. As the years rolled by, however, her fear gave way to acceptance, and then curiosity, as she realized how little regard and attention her masters paid her. She listened to the careless words of the Mikage lords and enforcers, and learned the truth. There was a massive Shadowkin rebellion against the Mikage Autocracy. There had been for almost a century… and it was winning. The palace guard had grown because Tatsu’s warlord feared for his life. She had been inducted to secure her loyalty, because the Mikage feared betrayal at every turn. Her family had died because even lowly, dissident peasants were a threat. \r\n\r\nThe Mikage were not invincible. They were weak, and they were dying… and Tatsu could help them die faster for, while her eyes were lost, she was blind no longer.\r\n\r\nA decade spent in darkness had pushed Tatsu to master what senses remained to her. After many years, she was shocked to find her Demonic magic helping her sense her surroundings, giving her a second sight. When she finally mastered it, she wept, thanking Lumaya for the first time since she was a little girl. She started training in secret, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\r\n\r\nThe moment came when Tatsu’s master hosted all the local warlords for a meeting. That night, she stole back her old swords and attacked the palace and swiftly killed the guards. She had trained them herself, and knew their every weakness. The Mikage lords were defenseless and showed their true colors. They fell to Tatsu’s feet, begging her for mercy, promising her all their power and luxury. All of their talk of strength and loyalty had been a mask – in truth, they were ruled only by greed and fear. Their deaths were quick.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the rest of the Mikage Autocracy took less than a decade.\r\n\r\nOnce the Shadowkin had their freedom, hard decisions were made. Many heroes of the rebellion were deemed too violent or unpredictable for the new regime, and as time went on they faced exile or even assassination. So it went with Tatsu. For fifteen years, she lived in a free Yakai, but those years were marked with growing isolation and fear from those around her. When a noble guest arrived at her house and gently suggested that she depart the kingdom, she was not surprised, nor even resentful. She had been allowed to stay longer than most others who had been Demon-touched. She left that very night.\r\n\r\nExile was no relief from persecution – the world beyond the Nyresan Union was not ready to see the Shadowkin as anything other than the servants of Siroth that they once were. Upon reaching the Free City of Arnoc, she was identified by her tattoos as a servant of the Mikage and thrown in prison, left to rot. Little did her guards know that she was immortal, and had patience to match – she had spent ten years as a blind gardener, and she could wait at least that long again to find her freedom.\r\n\r\nTatsu was biding her time when a new prisoner was placed in the cell next to hers, a Lizardman painter called Jizoh. All it took was a sketch on Jizoh's cell wall to change the course of Tatsu's eternal life – forever.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8010#static": "Gnut was born in an era of envy. His father, Duran, the Mountain King of Gloomdeep Hold, had watched for decades as the wealth and sophistication of foreigners outshined that of his own kingdom. King Duran had visited Gloomdeep’s only port, Port Wretched, many times, and on each occasion he found himself more and more incensed at what he found in the markets there. How had the outsiders managed to create such wonders? How were their ships so fine, their clothes so rich, and their magics so clever?\r\n\r\nDuran’s anger wasn’t only for the other races who visited Port Wretched. Indeed, the King’s greatest envy was for some of his own people. The Dwarven treasure fleets from the distant Skyiron Dominion had visited Port Wretched for centuries, their arrival as regular as clockwork. Each and every time King Duran greeted the Skyiron Admiral, he nearly shook with rage at how much a mere officer garbed themselves better than he. He railed at how the Dominion’s ceremonial gifts were always looked upon with awe by his court, and how his own gifts to the Dominion were always received with little more polite gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Skyiron Dominion shamed King Duran, for he thought himself a great king – but would a great king not have a great kingdom? The Mountains of Despair were a hard home, and Gloomdeep Hold, buried in the heart of those same mountains, produced a hard people. They were proud. They were strong. They were great. Finally, after half a lifetime of envy and shame, King Duran declared his intention to lay such a mound of opulence at the foot of the next Admiral that there could be no doubt that Gloomdeep Hold was the equal of the Skyiron Dominion. Any Dwarf who could find or forge a treasure to match a Skyiron prize would be hailed as a hero.\r\n\r\nAnd all eyes were on Gnut to produce the greatest treasure of all.\r\n\r\nIf only Gnut had been remotely prepared for such scrutiny. He had spent much of his youth tinkering with whatever whimsy came to mind – first in the forge, then the training yard, then the tavern, then the council chamber. And so Gnut became a master of nothing – not a great smith, nor a mighty warrior, nor a talented diplomat. His greatest talent was for producing bawdy versions of common tavern songs. He made for a delightful friend, but a poor hero.\r\n\r\nWith the King’s decree ringing through the austere halls of Gloomdeep Hold, Gnut found himself wondering how he might meet the expectations of his father’s court. He quickly discarded the idea of crafting something – he lacked the skill – but, he reasoned, even a poor warrior can luck his way into a victory. So, he clad himself in royal armor, and prepared himself for war.\r\n\r\nDespite the age of their kingdom, the Dwarves of Gloomdeep Hold had made only small and scattered settlements across the Mountains of Despair, leaving great tracks of territory unexplored. Gloomdeep’s depths were no less mysterious, with its underground reaches vanishing into a complex warren of abandoned tunnels whose age stretched back into the mists of history – tunnels once part of an empire that stretched beneath the whole of Teleria. There was no lack of possible places to uncover hidden treasures, both above and below.\r\n\r\nMost reputed among these rumored sites of buried treasure was an ancient castle, once a Dwarven holdfast but now the home of a terrible monster – known as the Fire Knight, the demon was a flaming brute clad in molten steel, wielding mace and fury such that none could defend against them. The treasures said to lie at the Fire Knight’s feet were glorious beyond measure, and the Fire Knight’s sacred shield bore a centerpiece that was said to be forged by the gods themselves. The gleaming mass of treasure that lay at his feet were said to be the possessions of fools who had taken their chances in a duel – and lost.\r\n\r\nGnut did not think it the wisest place to seek his gift to the king, but with no skill to tender, he knew he must try. With trepidation in his heart, Gnut announced an expedition to slay the Fire Knight. A celebration was held in honor of this great quest, and over the course of it, Gnut became intoxicated by the heady perfume of public approval. So intoxicated, in fact, that even he began to dismiss the dangers of his quest…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8020#static": "Bad-el-Kazar has been declared the greatest mage on the surface of Teleria. The truth of this declaration is debatable, but he is, without a doubt, incredibly powerful, and incredibly influential. He once ruled the grand city-state of Ireth with an iron fist, and some even claim that he was the very one to drag that glorious city into the corruption and ruin it is known for today. Sightings of Kazar can be traced all across the continents of Teleria, his purposes inscrutable. Many claim that he is a necromancer, hunted by the Sacred Order, while others claim he is, himself, Undead, blessed and cursed with eternal life. The more curious dare to ask themselves where his power might have come from.\r\n\r\nThe answer to that question is known to precious few, but if one traces back through history to find Ireth as it once was – a center of learning, of culture, of wisdom, and wealth – one would find a very sad young boy, standing at the window of his new prison-home, watching a ship sail away. The boy’s name was Valkanen, and he missed his mother.\r\n\r\nValkanen had not chosen to attend the Academy at Ireth. Back home in Kaerok, he had performed a powerful spell that had destroyed a man’s memory, reducing him to a blubbering beggar. The man had been Valkanen’s father. Valkanen’s protests – that he had cast the spell in self-defense – were little comfort to the paranoid townsfolk, and their attempts to get rid of him might have escalated to violence if not for the intercession of the local Duke’s house mage. The mage disrupted a fomenting riot, calming the angry crowd by taking the boy responsible away. ‘Away’ turned out to be half a world away – the mage took Valkanen across the sea, to the great continent of Peltas. There, nestled on the southern coastline of the Krokhan Desert, was Ireth.\r\n\r\nIreth was a glittering jewel at that point, and Valkanen had been suitably overwhelmed by its majesty when he had first arrived. But when he learned of his fate – that this was not a visit, but an exile – the city lost much of its luster to him. \r\n\r\nValkanen never lost that faint sense of resentment, but he did, at least, come to adapt to his circumstances. He learned he was an extremely powerful magic user, becoming a rising star in the Mage Academy, and he found himself the subject of much adoration by both fellow students and full-blooded mages alike. The respect and camaraderie was at first soothing, then later, addicting. As Valkanen grew into manhood, he became wholly dependent on the affection of others – their dreams of him growing into the greatest mage in Ireth became not only his own, but they replaced all his hopes and ambitions. \r\n\r\nBut those ambitions made competition intolerable. And competition did come, in the form of Arion – the son of the very duke who had Valkanen banished. Arion had poise, tact, and talent, and was quick to wrap the Academy around his finger. Was he as powerful, as skilled, or as promising as Valkanen? Promising, maybe, and he certainly had flair that Valkanen lacked. In the eyes of the Academy, though, it was enough that Arion at least presented himself as Valkanen’s superior – Ireth was hungry to have its star pupil tested. The teachers encouraged the rivalry, stoking the competition between them, hoping it would push them to improve. It worked… but it worked far too well. As his friends abandoned him at the urging of the senior mages, and as praise was heaped on the undeserving Arion, Valkanen was consumed with rage. The spotlight had been the only thing he had to hold on to, and he would not abide it being stolen.\r\n\r\nWhat few limits Valkanen had left melted away. Caution. Ethics. Self-preservation. Most consequential of all, incredulity. Valkanen sought power, from anywhere that he could find it, and he found it in a whisper in his dreams – a shadow at the corner of his eye, a fleeting figure in the mirror that was not a mere reflection. As Valkanen would learn – as all of Ireth would learn – there are sources of magic that are always waiting for those strong and foolish enough to reach for power without asking where it comes from… or what it might cost.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8030#static": "Today, Ambassador Lethelin is thought by some to be only quasi-historical, else entirely a fabrication of Elven propagandists. But real he was, though the great antiquity of his story has seen time mix truth with legends. His journey across Teleria was a remarkable fact, though many details over the centuries have become fabulous indeed.\r\n\r\nIn the Gray Age of Teleria, mortals were free as they had never been before, and not just from the physical presence of immortal masters. There was a seal on each of their hearts, a last lingering mote of divine will attempting to steer and control their destinies, and that seal had been broken. For each species of Teleria, the will of their creators echoed as a reminder for all time, but would be only that: a reminder, not a compulsion. And so it was that across Teleria there was a monumental Awakening, a time of self-discovery and unlimited possibilities. \r\n\r\nThe Elves, while still under divine influence, had been insular and introspective to a fault, obsessed with self-perfection and ideal harmony with nature. The Awakening gave them pragmatism, solidarity, and perspective. Some settled deep in Peltas alongside the enigmatic Fae, and became Sylvan. Others flocked to the nurturing valleys of northeast Anhelt, and there founded the kingdom of Aravia. They still revered the old ways, changed little, looked inward, and sought perfection. But now, they were awakened to the world around them, and knew they could not thrive in total isolation. A noble called Lethelin proposed a great diplomatic journey across Teleria, to witness its splendor and catalog all its peoples. Entrusted with scrying mirrors to contact the king’s noble council at a moment’s notice, he departed with a handpicked coterie. \r\n\r\nAmbassador Lethelin set forth sweeping west and south. He explored the melting pot of central Anhelt that would come to be called Kaerok, where Humans, Orcs, and Ogryn lived pastoral lives. He surveyed the Redspike Mountains, then bore south, mapping the coast. When he had nearly circumnavigated Anhelt’s shores and reached the Valdemar Strait, he was near to Aravia once more and was sorely homesick, but pressed on into Peltas.\r\n\r\nEverywhere he went, Lethelin and his companions flew the banner of Aravia and told of its glories, exchanging tales for tales. Aravian scribes recorded lore and testimony through the party’s scrying mirrors. Certain obscure cultures and histories would have been forever lost had not Lethelin’s expedition recorded them for Elven posterity. \r\n\r\nThe decades-long journey was not without peril. Primeval monsters stalked the vast wildlands that separated the young civilizations of the world, and now and then hostile peoples took poorly to the Elves’ presence in their territory. Lethelin led his crew in battle with courage and charisma, his Aravian banner always flying high to rally them and his words bearing subtle healing magics to reinvigorate the flesh and spirit of those who heard him. \r\n\r\nThe brave explorers always knew that they were risking their very lives, especially as they embarked toward the archipelagos that lay south of the two largest Telerian continents. Long sea journeys were a new challenge, one that proved Lethelin’s undoing: the king and his court witnessed in real time a terrific storm send Lethelin and the enchanted mirrors he carried to the bottom of the sea. Unbeknownst to all, the Sin of Dragons had been committed, and the Ambassador's ship was caught in the volcanic devastation that saw Allreach wiped from the face of Teleria.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8040#static": "In the frozen wastes of northernmost Teleria there once lived the Old Norr, whose descendants still tell an ancient fable about a blighted soul known as Weregren Suncursed. Weregren is perhaps the first Skinwalker ever to exist, centuries before their mass emergence in the Age of Treachery. Descriptions of his monstrous form indicate he was similar to, but not precisely like, more modern Skinwalkers. Perhaps he was a primitive prototype, a dark fruit of Siroth’s premature experimentation. Or perhaps he was something completely unique. It is difficult for modern sages to interpret, because the legend records nothing of his previous history or personality. The story begins with Weregren’s bestial transformation and descriptions of his hideous hairy visage, and of his great capacity for violence and madness. He went into a frenzy, killing and maiming, and the tale praises the valor of those who fought and subdued him. \r\n\r\nThen, the saga proceeds to its most lengthy section, which details Weregren’s punishment. A Human would have been put to death for a rampage like Weregren’s. But the Norr were spiritually uncertain about this monster – was he a rational being, culpable for his malevolence, or an innocent soul gripped by madness? Wise law-speakers were sought, and they ordained an extreme trial by ordeal not attested to elsewhere in Norr traditions.\r\n\r\nWeregren was branded so that he would be forever marked an accursed exile, should he escape or survive what was to come. The massive burn festered and scarred as his captors prepared the next part of his ordeal. His arms and legs were submerged in barrels of scalding water and held fast inside, one for each limb – torture to a normal Human, but Weregren merely snarled in contempt. Then, all four barrels were brought outside with Weregren’s limbs still submerged, the water left to freeze solid. A normal Human might well have expired from the pain, shock, and cold by this point. Weregren endured, but his judgment was still not complete. \r\n\r\nThe barrels were disassembled, leaving each appendage encased in a huge block of ice. He was dragged into the middle of nowhere and left upon the featureless ice sheet, having been blindfolded so that his disorientation would be total. He was told that the searing rays of the sun would determine his guilt. If they melted his massive shackles of ice, the Divine had taken mercy on him and spared him his monstrous existence, although his brand would remain to mark him an outlaw to the Norr forever. Otherwise, he would suffer the torment of the sun’s glare burning his flesh while it yet froze, and he would perish an abomination. Blocking their ears against his deafening, inhuman howls, the Norr left Weregren to this fate – the ‘Sun Curse.’ \r\n\r\nFolklorists agree that such an elaborate and brutal punishment must have been pre-established rather than spontaneous, and intended for the most heinous crimes imaginable. But, being designed by Humans to torture and kill a Human, it was perhaps not sufficient for Weregren, a Skinwalker, or whatever he truly was. For the tale of Weregren Suncursed ends ominously. It is stated that for the rest of that year’s season of endless sun – likely many months – the Norr heard faint cries on the wind, and distant crashes and tremors, as though Weregren were raging against the massive weights on his limbs and smashing them against the ground in fury. When the sun finally set for the season of darkness, the omens ceased. But there ends the tale: evidently, none were bold enough to confirm Weregren’s ultimate fate.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8050#static": "Ethlen the Golden is a folk hero of Aravia who has been sighted by the desperate and forlorn from the Age of Hellfire centuries ago, up to the present day. No Elf could possibly attain such a lifespan, and so the Ethlen of the tales must have changed from one masked and veiled savior to another who took up the name and the distinctive gold regalia. \r\n\r\nThough Ethlen adorns himself in rich golden splendor, he does not keep his arms and armor in a state of polished, gleaming perfection. They bear the dust of the road and dirt of the fields, the wear and tear of long journeys and tough battles, and shine only where the golden surface is worn smooth from constant use. Ethlen is no idle, ostentatious nobleman, though he always seems to hold himself with regal bearing and dignity. Likewise he speaks little, letting his deeds speak for him. His cause is protecting those who cannot protect themselves, from vicious wildlife, twisted monstrosities, and malicious Telerians in equal measure. \r\n\r\nEthlen’s interventions are famously brief and efficient. Alongside his taciturnity, Ethlen makes no excess movements, pointless flourishes, or uncalculated steps. He wields a small blade in close quarters, as well as his hooked staff, a famed instrument of his heroic rescues. He uses it to swing from branches, ward off beasts, lever fallen logs and boulders off of injured victims, and many other things. \r\n\r\nAnd then there are his mysterious golden stakes, a common crescendo to Ethlen’s flurries of attacks. Hurling tiny needles of gold with deadly precision, Ethlen deals painful but minor wounds. But then, Ethlen – or perhaps the needles themselves – summons piercing crystalline manifestations thrumming with magic, which are drawn to the golden needles like lightning to a rod. The alchemical properties of gold, the most noble and imperishable metal, are much debated by cabalists, and perhaps Ethlen discovered a secret to exploit such an mysterious property. The results, whether Ethlen’s powers are holy, alchemical, or arcane in derivation, are quite distinct: grievous pain and fiercely persistent immobilization of the surrounding flesh. \r\n\r\nThough Ethlen fights his share of Siroth-spawn with stoic determination to help those in need, he shows a greater penchant for combatting those mortals who, endowed with reason and compassion as the enlightened children of the gods, still choose violence against their fellows. In punishing brigands and cutthroats, Ethlen reveals the nearest glimmers of emotion or flair, using his paralytic golden missiles to thwart their shakedowns and predation and, if he can, inflict extra pain and humiliation on the thugs while bearing the innocent away to safety. In the Ugrun Swamp, situated between Kaerok and Aravia, for example, notorious bandits were disrupting the trade routes that were the long-suffering locals’ only link with the outside world. Ethlen left a band of their raiders face-down in the murk struggling to breathe through the disgusting slurry, their arms and legs immobilized by wounds from golden spines that would otherwise be superficial. But when a ferocious, mud-stained dire-wolf set upon the helpless bandits, Ethlen drove the beast away and saved them, too. \r\n\r\nThough the frequency of his appearances has steadily waned, stories of the roving savior Ethlen have persisted down generations. Most think the first trained a disciple, who in turn trained his own successor, and so on. Others have wilder theories still, calling Ethlen an immortal Firstborn.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8130#static": "Emic Trunkheart does not know where he came from, nor does he understand the meanings of life and the world beyond his overpowering drive to serve and protect the Mistwood. Sylvan Watchers have yet to successfully communicate with this lone sentinel – though they sense him through the Rhythm, Trunkheart follows a different tune. Some speculate that he is a manifestation of the corrupted Rhythm, twinned with the virtuous souls of fallen warriors.\r\n\r\nThere is only one who claims to know the absolute truth, the Elven minstrel, Lila Stringpicker. She tells Emic’s story to the Sylvan from the smallest treetop villages to the grand halls of Nyresa.\r\n\r\nThe tale begins when the Sylvan lords ordered a counterattack on the corrupted Sylvan and Demonspawn that had infested the Mistwood, after the corruption had driven the Sylvan from their sacred Heart Tree. Many years had passed since the establishment of Nyresa, but the Sylvan still mourned their lost woods and abandoned homes. An army was sent to reclaim the remains of the ancient Heart Tree and surrounding woodland, and to purge the evil from its long-reaching roots.\r\n\r\nThe battle lasted for days. The Sylvan Watchers fought with such fierce determination that the Demonspawn could not afford to take any of them prisoner. In their desperate defense, the Demonspawn scorched swathes of land and thousands of Sylvan were incinerated in the flames. Despite the Sylvan warriors’ greatest efforts to cleanse the Heart Tree, the darkness that poisoned the land was unshakable. The warriors succeeded only in slowing the corruption’s spread before Demonspawn butchered so many the remnants of the army were forced to retreat.\r\n\r\nThe sacrifice of these warriors was instrumental in the war against evil, buying time for the eventual halting of the corruption by Shadowkin, Sylvan, and Skyiron Dwarves years later, and their contributions helped to quell the malice from further ravaging the forest. None could retrieve their bodies to honor them, however. Their blood soaked the earth and their flesh fed the Heart Tree’s roots, and in time, their lives faded into stories of noble heroes told to children under starlight.\r\n\r\nBut the Heart Tree remembered them. Though the hatred and darkness of evil was so deeply entrenched that the Tree was to be forever scarred by its corruption, those warriors’ songs yet echoed in the roots. Through the Rhythm, they had once been bound to the Heart Tree, and in death, the Tree had snared a fraction of their souls in its roots. They had dwelt within the Heart Tree for many winters, slowly growing.\r\n\r\nIt is at this part of the story where the minstrel claims she herself played a vital role. Lila had been traveling the Mistwood’s scorched lands in search of long forgotten symphonies. While avoiding detection from maddened Fae dwelling there, she heard a peculiar tune and followed it to the blackened husk of the Heart Tree. From beneath the rotten bark came a faint heartbeat that pounded in reply when she knocked on the soft wood. She dug into the Tree with a knife, pulling away dead mulch to find a small part of healthy, brown wood beneath. This twisted and shook, morphing into a figure of a warrior no doubt in memory of the Sylvan Watchers who had fallen at the foot of the Tree years before.\r\n\r\nLila tried to take this little warrior with her, but the Fae refused to leave its birth grounds, so she continued her travels alone. She ventured the dangerous woodland for the remainder of the season and was awoken one night by a Demonspawn dragging her through the thorns. The minstrel kicked and screamed, knowing in her heart that none would come to her aid – yet something did. A creature of wood and leaf crashed against the Demonspawn. It slammed the Demonspawn away from Lila with its shield, and hacked the Demonspawn to pieces with its ax. This unknown savior resembled the little wooden figure she had found before. It was fully grown and resounding with not only a profound, noble will to defend, but also a frightful, vengeful power that would see its purpose through with no remorse.\r\n\r\nLila named it Emic Trunkheart and spread the tale of a creature forged from the scarred Heart Tree and heroic souls. How much of the minstrel’s story is fictitious remains to be seen but Sylvan Watchers have witnessed a Fae that matches her descriptions fighting threats from the corruption that still pollute the land, and felt its strange presence in the Rhythm. A silent, armored-looking figure, appearing as if whittled from wood, patrols the regions surrounding the Sacred Grove, watching anyone who enters its domain. Whether or not it would attack Sylvan is unknown, none have been brave enough to get close. Unsettled by the mysterious creature, the Sylvan hope it will strike the same fear in the hearts of any who dare to harm the forest.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8140#static": "During the terrible events known to history as the Sin of Dragons, legions of Dragonkin marched into Anathraad to subjugate Siroth himself to their will. They were annihilated. Barely a fraction of the army survived, among their number a warrior called Ignator, who was so overawed by the power of the Shadow God and his Demon hosts, he was certain that the only way mortals could ever see Siroth’s power wielded in their favor was to join him. The Sin of Dragons heralded the fall of the Dragonkin Empire, and Ignator wanted nothing more than to not just restore the empire, but make it greater than it ever had been. He and a band of allies made a home in the Deadlands, studying and worshiping Siroth in isolation, hoping their god would come to them. He never did, and centuries passed. The descendants of Ignator and his fellows lived on, the ways of their cult becoming increasingly mysterious even to them. Sulfuryion changed everything.\r\n\r\nHatched from Ignator’s direct lineage, Sulfuryion was strong of arm, hard of scale, and keen of mind. He quickly outgrew the backward clan that was the remainder of Ignator’s legacy, choosing to depart on a quest for further enlightenment. With little knowledge of what ‘Demonspawn’, ‘Anathraad’, ‘Siroth’, and ‘the portal’ were, he set out to learn, and with that knowledge do more for his cult than any ever had before.\r\n\r\nAfter a decade of wandering, speaking with the wise-women of Nomad clans, Orc Shamans, and hermit-wizards, Sulfuryion heard of a being known as Rorkar the Outcast – a real Demonspawn. Following the guidance of merchants and wanderers, he found the creature, and told it everything. Rorkar laughed mightily at what it heard, yet did not deny the truth of any of it. For the amusement alone, Rorkar agreed show him an old, hidden portal to Anathraad, and promised the Lizardman that only death lay within. If somehow Sulfuryion survived, he could repay Rorkar then. They traveled to the ruins of Castle Morlar at the edge of the Stormwind Wastes, and there Rorkar fulfilled his word. Trembling with excitement and terror, Sulfuryion stepped through the portal.\r\n\r\nAnathraad was barely less deadly than Rorkar claimed. Sulfuryion wrestled the great Demon-serpent Slythaar, solved the Riddles of the Nine Horns, and, after defeating the Demonspawn Klazix, was judged worthy of an audience with the Shadow God. Siroth was vaguely amused that a descendant of the Dragonkin had sought him out, and his hubris was stoked by the fact that a spawn of the very empire he had destroyed was now entreating him for the opportunity to become his servant. Siroth accepted, and made Sulfuryion a Demonspawn.\r\n\r\nTriumphant, Sulfuryion, wreathed in fire and shadow, returned to his old clan to preach to them of his success, and he was hailed as Siroth’s herald and a demigod. Some among the clan wished to follow him into Anathraad and receive Siroth’s boons for themselves, but Sulfuryion refused to show them the portal, claiming he was the chosen one and that the rest of the clan had not yet proven themselves worthy. In truth, he did not wish to share his powers, and he had further plans to use it. He wanted to dawn a new age of Dragonkin dominance, and wished to rule it as a new Dragon Emperor in service to Siroth.\r\n\r\nSulfuryion ordered his clan to set out to ‘unify’ the Lizardmen. He declared that he was a descendent of the last Dragon Emperor and that he had been ordained to recreate the Dragonkin Empire, and Sulfuryion defeated and subjugated any clan that refused to join his. It was his vision, he claimed, that the Lizardmen would first come together and then have their revenge on the Demonspawn by becoming Demonspawn themselves. By securing immortality, they would have the strength to vanquish these ancient creatures and put Lizardmen immediately below the Shadow God. To prove themselves worthy, they would first conquer Teleria in Siroth’s name, under Sulfuryion’s direction.\r\n\r\nSulfuryion’s clan of dark Lizardmen is treated with fear and suspicion by some among their kind, but with reverence by others. There is no doubt that the blessings of Siroth are strong, for Sulfuryion himself possesses deadly intelligence and a fiery charisma. In combat he is akin to a force of nature, his mane blazing with hellfire, his black and red scales glittering and seemingly impervious to any sword, spear, or ax. With predatory speed and Demon-imbued strength, he cuts down any foe who dares challenge him with his bone sword, and those who withstand it soon fall prey to his razor-edged fangs and talons. Whether he will one day truly recreate a dark mirror of the Dragonkin Empire or whether he is simply another pawn in one of Siroth’s many games remains to be seen.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8150#static": "As an Orc mercenary fighting in the land of Anhelt, Jagg expected to meet his end in battle or, perhaps, win enough to afford a passage across to Peltas, where he hoped to find a scrap of uncontested land and live in peace. Neither realities would come to pass, at least not before the Orc was first broken and changed beyond all recognition.\r\n\r\nWhen Pernost Blacksail – an unscrupulous Elven corsair – planned a raid on a Dwarven treasure fleet, the Elf recruited Jagg and many other Orc mercenaries to bolster his crew. The Dwarf fleet was sailing from the Skyiron Dominion to Port Wretched of Gloomdeep Hold and an attack offered high rewards, for a single captured gold-galleon would make every member of the party unfathomably rich. But the chances of success were slim, for each treasure fleet was heavily armed and protected. Pernost hoped that the extra mercenaries would tip the balance, but the arrogant Elf was badly mistaken, for his efforts ran afoul of the dreaded flagship of the treasure fleets, the Brassclad. The struggle was brutally one-sided, with the veteran crew of the Dwarven flagship triumphing. Most of the pirate crew were sent to the depths and Pernost himself was nailed to the Brassclad’s prow. But not all of the sea raiders were put to death.\r\n\r\nThe Dwarves manning the Brassclad were under secret orders to spare any Orc pirates taken prisoner and deliver them to Gloomdeep Hold. Two-dozen such prisoners were given over to a clandestine Dwarf guild, one which operated outside the scrutiny of the Mountain King. Known as the Iron League, they were a conglomerate of Dwarf inventors and scientists whose purpose was the creation of ever larger and more deadly weapons for the employment of their people. Their main focus was on making war machines and projectile launchers, but they also strayed into biological experimentation.\r\n\r\nOrcs were considered to be prime fodder for such efforts, and so the capture of a clutch of Orc pirates was considered a boon. Jagg suffered with the rest: his left arm was amputated and replaced with a vicious Dwarf fire-saw normally used in steelwork, and a jagged collar of metal was latched around his shoulders. His nerve-endings were burned out, leaving his flesh unfeeling and immune to pain. Morren Cragbrow, the Dwarf overseer responsible for experimenting on Jagg, tested her work in secret gladiatorial bouts. Though Jagg was victorious time and time again, the clashes left him with injuries that Cragbrow augmented with new blades and spikes.\r\n\r\nThe Iron League was straying too far, according to some. Rivals accused them of being depraved and corrupt, and successfully petitioned the Mountain King to outlaw the organization and strike it down. In a raid led by the city’s infamous Dock Guard – for so many of the League's subjects arrived through Port Wretched – the organization’s facilities were torched, along with many living experiments, but in the chaos some escaped. Jagg was among them, fleeing into Gloomdeep Hold's sewers – but not before he had exacted brutal vengeance on Cragbrow. \r\n\r\nSwathed in a heavy cloak, Jagg concealed himself on a waste barge and was able to make his way from the sewers undetected. When the vessel dumped its refuse in the ocean, Jagg hacked his blades into the boat’s timber and held fast until the ship reached its return destination, Port Wretched. A neutral haven for peoples of all races, and popular with criminals and pirates for that reason, the port was a perfectly neutral melting pot – an ideal place for Jagg to regain his strength while hiding from anyone from Gloomdeep who might be hunting escaped experiments – even the ever-vigilant Dock Guard. He soon became first mate to a fellow-Orc and sea captain, Drok Redtide, on his ship, the Sire of Desolation. After the pirate’s death at the later Battle of Mutineer's Cove, Jagg acquired command of Redtide’s crew and ship.\r\n\r\nEver since then, Jagg has operated out of Bleakhaven in the Lost Isles, earning a dark reputation as a captain who enjoys torturing his victims. As one of the most infamous pirates in Teleria, he has acquired many vessels and earned the loyalty, respect, and total fear of numerous other captains. It’s known that he is building his own fleet of ships – for Jagg’s ultimate ambition is to again attack the Dwarven treasure fleets. Taking just one treasure ship would bring riches and renown… but Jagg’s drive is vengeance, to strike a blow against Gloomdeep Hold that will never be forgotten.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8160#static": "Strategos Islin is considered by some to be one of the finest commanders Aravia has ever produced. He has never attempted to disabuse anybody of that belief, for Islin’s keen military mind is matched only by his pride.\r\n\r\nIslin first rose to prominence as a leader during the campaigns to establish High Elf colonies on the western coast of Peltas. As a junior officer without distinction, he commanded the defense of the White Tower, an Aravian coastal outpost attacked by the Orc warlord Gorr Bloodhand. The garrison was hugely outnumbered, but through the careful husbanding of supplies, and precise, deadly sallies through a hidden magical port in the tower’s flank, the defenders kept the enemy at bay until relief arrived.\r\n\r\nThe victory saw Islin promoted. Soon he had command of his own army during the campaign to secure a safe route from the western extent of the Valdemar Strait to the furthest north-eastern outpost, near the Thundermount, driving out a confederation of Orc clans and Ogryn tribes angered by the Aravian encroachment. Tactically adept, Islin lured the often numerically superior enemy into attacking a set position, and then struck their flank with a hidden reserve. Islin’s abilities soon saw him commanding all High Elf forces on the Peltas coast. While the Elf presence there remained somewhat scattered and tenuous, under Islin’s direction it held on. No mere back-line general, at the Battle of Felwater Islin joined the counterattack against the Orc surge, doing brutal work with his two-handed broadsword, Eagle’s Talon, while at Dawnmoor he led the reserve to shore up a breach in the line, his shining helm and white cloak acting like a beacon for the near-overwhelmed High Elf soldiery.\r\n\r\nIslin’s successes in Peltas had done much to restore Aravia’s reputation after a series of disastrous campaigns against the Dark Elves in Durham Forest. Queen Eva of Aravia bestowed upon him nobility and the role of chief military counselor to the kingdom, that of strategos. In such a role he would not only command the Aravian armies, but was expected to play a part in the High Elf court, advising on any matters relating to the military or potential enemies and guiding the queen’s overall strategies.\r\n\r\nWar had made a hero of Islin, but after being recalled to Aravia he grew idle. His successes on the battlefield might have earned him renown, but the world of Aravian politics proved to be a different kind of test altogether. Used to the obedience of his soldiers, Islin struggled with the underhand tactics and shifting loyalties of the court’s members. Nevertheless, his record of military success still demanded respect, and he steadily amassed followers and political allies. He earned a reputation for bluntness and honesty, one which gained the invaluable favor of the queen herself. Other nobles with former military service or connections to Aravia’s armies also rallied to the former general, increasing his influence. He learned to not take courtiers at their word, and to adapt and apply his strategic abilities toward political ends.\r\n\r\nIslin had always been a proud man, but as he grew into his new role in the Aravian court, his arrogance increased. He was popular with the Aravian soldiery and with many of the common people, and soon was being courted by a number of different factions. He came to refer to himself as the White Eagle, an unsubtle nod to the great Elven ruler Basileus Roanas, who had stemmed the Demonspawn tide during the First Great War. Ultimately, his arrogance was his undoing, for his opponents were able to convince others that his bluff honesty was a cover for his true desire – to claim the throne.\r\n\r\nHow true claims of Islin’s planned coup were remains a point of conjecture. It seems unlikely that the thought of usurping Aravia’s queen had never crossed his proud mind, yet the belief of some that the armies of Aravia were just one order away from rising up in armed rebellion to put the White Eagle on the throne are also surely exaggerated. What is certain is that Islin’s opponents acted swiftly and decisively. The queen was convinced that Islin was a threat to the realm, and after a trial that Islin claimed was rigged against him, he was banished from the kingdom.\r\n\r\nSince that day Islin has traveled Anhelt, a noble without an estate, a general without an army. Though summarily stripped of the title of strategos, he still refers to himself by it, and claims that when he eventually makes his return to Aravia, it will herald the rising of his armies and the long-awaited succession of the White Eagle to the throne.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8170#static": "Among the Dawnmounts lies a volcano called the Red Grandfather by the local Nomads, for its scorching slopes are crimson-hued from rust-colored minerals and sometimes from the glowing, flaming blood of the earth. Fren’zi of the Krokhan Nomads, a warrior and pyromancer apprenticed to the shaman of her clan, was one of many seekers who made pilgrimage to the volcano in search of a deeper spiritual connection to fire. One might even see the Red Grandfather himself, the spirit of the mountain, the soul of magma: a giant, red as the slopes, who would emerge if the pilgrim showed their worthiness. He only appeared on the higher slopes where few could survive for long. But if one braved the danger, found the giant, and asked with humble respect, one could receive a boon. \r\n\r\nPerhaps overeager after long anticipation, Fren’zi set off with little preparation. She had great stamina and endurance, and high tolerance for heat, much like all desert-dwelling people. She was also exceptionally sturdy, even for a Nomad. But even she was unprepared for the intense, boot-melting heat, the explosions of noxious gas, and the rarified air. She became delirious, and started wandering at random, slowly broiling to death. Instinct and chance led her off the lethal slopes, and she wandered into the desert in a stupor before collapsing.\r\n\r\nFren’zi was snapped out of her fugue by the agony of her own flesh being devoured by scavengers. She still reflexively resisted with her last morsels of vitality, despite the tempting release of death so close at hand. But then a pack of hyenas arrived and scattered the lesser carnivores. As a dozen slavering jaws closed in on her, Fren’zi furiously vowed to take at least one down with her.\r\n\r\nLashing out with her hooked sword, she split the skull of the first beast as the rest engulfed her. Her last impression as pain overwhelmed her was a sudden blast of intense heat – as though she were on the slopes of the volcano once more. When she came to, she was a Skinwalker with the form of a hyena, her wounded and weakened body regenerated and transformed by the curse. All the hyenas lay dead, the stink of their scorched smoldering flesh and fur filling the air. Had she summoned a last desperate burst of pyromancy, or had someone else? In the distance she thought she glimpsed a great red lumbering form disappearing over the horizon… but it may only have been the shimmer of the distant Red Grandfather distorted in the desert heat. \r\n\r\nFren’zi made her way back to the volcano’s foothill camp, where she was aided by one of the healers making a living tending those who, like her, had been turned back in agony by the mountain. Though a twitchy, muttering wreck, her strength returned rapidly. But no healer could fix her mind, which had been bent by her ordeal. The high-pitched cackling of a hyena came unbidden to her new canine lips, and she struggled to organize and contain her thoughts. Through a haze of derangement, she still clings to one burning hope: reaching the giant of the mountain and begging his assistance in cleansing her mind.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8180#static": "Many feats of architecture, engineering, seafaring, and warfare accomplished all over Teleria would not be possible without devices and insights that Dwarves originally provided. Isbeil, creator of the Fyr-gun, would love to join the illustrious list of world-renowned Dwarven inventors, but it will not be easy given the forces arrayed against her who would see her innovation crushed and forgotten. Isbeil’s detractors point to her youth and her rebellious streak, calling her a dangerous renegade tinkerer and her device a menace to herself and others. Their prejudices merely blind them to the Fyr-gun’s true potential, she believes. \r\n\r\nIn Port Wretched, Isbeil was effectively an orphan, ignored by her neglectful parents and herself scornful of relying on them. She was socially awkward, leaping from topic to topic in her conversations and logic. But this feverish pace of thinking produced bursts of visionary insight, and a passionate need to create. She was nearly caught numerous times breaking into workshops, forges, and guildhalls for tools and materials. In so doing she cobbled together a sort of hybrid apprenticeship for herself despite the vicious canines and dangerous traps supposed to be defending against intruders like her.\r\n\r\nIsbeil’s efforts culminated in mechanical engineering, geochemistry, and Dwarven rune magic literally crashing together to create an explosive result. First, she concocted a secret mixture of stone powders and acids. The resulting paste she dabbed onto the receiving tray of a steel contraption resembling a spring-loaded hammer and anvil. She then triggered the device and the paste was struck at high speed by a miniature hammer bearing upon its head a Dwarven rune-mark which variously denotes ‘ignition,’ ‘spark,’ or ‘inspiration.’ The power of the rune interacted with the chemical matrix of Isbeil’s fuel as it was compressed by the swift impact, and converted the fuel into fire – so explosively fast that this first prototype blasted itself apart and gave Isbeil a swath of painful scars.\r\n\r\nIsbeil quickly realized that she could weaponize the reaction, and finally perfected her Fyr-gun, the seventh prototype and her beloved magnum opus. She made the detonation useful by channeling the blast down a long tube, to which she added an blade so it could double as a sturdy hatchet if needed. It had to be robust, to contain and direct the energies of Isbeil’s reaction. The blast wave from the detonation was an impressive sight and a lethal percussive force. It had drawbacks compared to traditional bows and crossbows. But it had distinct advantages in terms of raw destructive power and the spectacular terror it could cause. \r\n\r\nBecause of her lack of charisma and unsavory origin, Isbeil struggled to garner the credit she deserved. The owners of the arms manufactories where Isbeil tried to publicize her creation were outwardly dismissive of it, but in confidence among each other, they were greatly concerned that the Fyr-gun would disrupt their tidy, profitable businesses.\r\n\r\nTo showcase her creation, Isbeil began snapping up high-value bounties and mercenary contracts, claiming a dozen at once just to hog the opportunities, and left charred and splattered bits of various criminals and outlaws lying on the planks of ships or in the back of blind alleys. In the process however she angered several people whose bounty offers she took up and then ignored. Between them, the wealthy cabal of arms traders, and the vengeful associates of those whose bounties she hunted, Fyr-gun Isbeil is perhaps due for a series of explosive confrontations. Word of Isbeil has reached Hurndig, the Supreme Engineer of the Skyiron Dominion, however. He is deeply intrigued, and if he has his way she will soon be working in his forges, with all the resources she can dream of.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8200#static": "In a time of terrible corruption and death, Aeila was a giver of purity and life. A dire evil had engulfed the Heart Tree of the Sylvan, and tendrils of Darkness were weaving their way throughout the Mistwood, root and branch. General unease and sporadic violence gave way to increasing anarchy and immense suffering. Waves of twisted Fae tore through the woods, straining the defenses of countless Sylvan settlements. Madness turned friends and kin against each other, and the empathic connection of the Rhythm meant the insanity could easily spread. It took incredible effort for Sylvan such as Aeila to pull away from the psychic milieu of the now-corrupted Rhythm, the primal heartbeat that had nurtured and sustained them all their days. The call of Siroth’s perverted Heart Tree was intense, but for some, their revulsion and terror at what their beloved Rhythm had become was enough to overcome its darkly powerful attractive force. \r\n\r\nAeila and her fellow resistors fled their fallen homes as refugees, seeking supplies, succor, and allies. Decades elapsed as the Mistwood churned with evil and the struggle to redeem it raged on. Aeila, though vengeance was on her mind, more keenly felt a terrible sorrow and pity for the suffering of her people. Most of the survivors bore wounds from basic traumas or from the ichor-slickened claws of the corrupt Fae, which brought grievous long-term festering affliction. Heartbroken, Aeila retreated to fond memories of childhood. Her Fae father was a minor noble and often absent, but Aeila’s Elf mother was a devoted guardian. Aeila remembered golden days of sunshine amid the lush boughs, when her mother would sing Elf-songs to her and braid her long hair, filling her heart with gladness and warmth. She wept for such bygone days, for fear they might never come again. But the tears hardened her resolve, and she sought out the healers treating the injured. She asked to take up apprenticeship among them, and they were glad to have an extra set of hands to aid in their constant, urgent work. \r\n\r\nIn both magical and mundane healing techniques, Aeila proved a natural talent. She sang her mother’s songs, wove petals into the hair of the stricken, and prayed for the mercy of nature untainted – for life to pardon old wounds with new flesh, and forgive slights with new growth. Her radiant compassion and the high level of care and attention she always gave to her charges led to miraculous recoveries. She came to be called Lifebraid, for her distinctive locks and for the way she seemed to weave a thread of health into the sickly. Aeila was thrilled to see the fruits of her labor, the smiles of those whose limbs were restored to function and whose internal ailments had abated. \r\n\r\nIf only the Sylvan could have had all the time they needed to heal from their trauma. However, their struggle could not let them rest. War followed them, and Aeila was forced to take up sword and shield to defend herself and her patients from the spies, outriders, and vanguards of Mistwood’s horde of terrors. Necessity made a fine warrior out of her, but even in battle she sang her healing songs and prayed for the redemption of the corrupted that she had to slay. After some two centuries of strife, with the help of a newfound coalition, the Sylvan prevailed. Aeila lived to see this glorious victory, still active in the twilight of a long life spent giving generously of everything she could. Such dedication did not go unnoticed by the Arbiter, who knew Teleria would need Aeila in the future.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8210#static": "Siegfrund the Nephilim is an aberration, a fusion of opposites: part Demonspawn, part Lightbringer. Demonspawn and Lightbringers as seen in Teleria are mortal bodies inhabited by extraplanar beings, who are able to bypass the ancient banishment spell that excludes the gods and the Firstborn from the mortal world. But, if such second-order manifestations of Light and Darkness can exist upon Teleria, could they be merged in a second-order union? This radical concept was the goal of a certain cabal of sorcerers and theologians who were active during the intellectual and social upheavals of the Great Schism of the Lumayan Church and the fall of Narbuk. They were called Nephilists for their belief in what they called a Nephilim, a fusion of Demonspawn and Lightbringer, which they conjectured would result in a superior being of incalculable power and sagacity. Even other revolutionary thinkers called their ideas mad, but the Nephilists were capable and determined, and funded by wealthy obsessives. After much preparation, they achieved something remarkable in its own right: they stalked and bound a powerful Demonspawn whose name has been lost to time. With rare magics and ancient relics, the Nephilists numbed the connection between the Demonspawn’s body and soul, and bound him in runed, silver chains. \r\n\r\nThe Nephilists built a tower to contain their prize and reinforce its magical bindings, on a secluded hummock in the Dusk Hills from where dread Ireth was just visible on the horizon. After more preparations and inscrutable rituals, the Nephilists began the second phase of their magnum opus, the attempted infusion of a Lightbringer soul. How they would shackle a Lightbringer and somehow force them to cohabit the Demonspawn’s form was the greatest and most closely-guarded secret of their sect. It, along with each and every participant in the final ritual, perished at the moment of Siegfrund’s fusion. The very concept of creating a Nephilim was purged violently from Telerian history by its own realization.\r\n\r\nThe middlemen who supplied the Nephilists with provisions eventually came with a shipment and found the tower obliterated, with only the ground floor still partially standing. These porters fled in terror, and that, as far as the world could reckon, was the end of the Nephilists and their mad scheme. But for Siegfrund the Nephilim the tower's destruction was only the explosive beginning of a secret, tortured existence.\r\n\r\nSiegfrund emerged from the rubble of his creation as a cosmological paradox, a spiritual abomination – two souls, two bodies, overlapping and coexisting in the selfsame pocket of time and space. Neither Siegfrund the Demonspawn nor the unknown Lightbringer were coherent personalities remaining within the Nephilim, but their powerful Light and Darkness energy remained raging within him along with their scrambled souls, constantly superseding and overriding each other in a chaotic equilibrium. Siegfrund vanished from the ruined tower into the trackless Krokhan Desert. There he found the mouth of an ancient underground tomb, and retreated within, not from the baking sun but from a reflexive need to isolate and hide from the world. Siegfrund knew that he should not exist, and both wished to undo himself but also feared what might happen if he did. His young, fractured, incoherent mind identified with what he found in the crypt: a grave marked with the name 'Siegfrund', in which bones rested within antique armor, a broken sword and shield laying upon the breast. Siegfrund removed the bones, donned the armor, and took up the same pose, becoming dead to the world yet still alive. For centuries he lay in the tomb undisturbed, contemplating his own existence, his form intermingling with the plate he wore, so that it became him. \r\n\r\nIn this long isolation, Siegfrund was able to better integrate his Demonspawn and Lightbringer halves, though only in the realm of his thoughts – he dared not awaken himself, but only prepared for it in deathly meditation. He would keep his Lightbringer nature largely in control, for control was the nature of Light, nor did he dare risk allowing the creative and freedom-loving Darkness within him to become too dominant. But he also knew he should not extinguish either, for the gestalt was the essence of Teleria, and he was of Teleria.\r\n\r\nSiegfrund was finally discovered by Irethi ghoul-thralls, and soon afterward a host of fascinated necromancers arrived. They wished to perform grisly experiments upon Siegfrund, but unbeknownst to them he was listening to their discussion and decided that the time had come to test his control of his hybrid self. When he rose from the sepulcher, the necromancers were terrified, for they held some inkling as to Siegfrund’s true nature and the power he could wield. They and their ghouls assaulted him forthwith, and he fought back. To his surprise, his Demonspawn half was dormant as he cleft ghouls in twain with his sword and splattered necromancer brains against the dusty walls with a stroke from his huge shield. The righteous fury of the Lightbringer within shone bright – perhaps it had been some particularly ferocious crusader. \r\n\r\nThe last sorcerer begged for mercy, but a moment too late, as Siegfrund swung his heavy blade into the necromancer’s torso. Hearing the plea, Siegfrund was struck by mournfulness and confusion. The will to learn and grow and change is the essence of Darkness, and Siegfrund saw the death of the apparently repentant necromancer as an affront to this desire. His stern, emotionless Lightbringer half retreated, and Siegfrund changed and warped, sprouting great wings and glowing with the magmatic fire of Darkness that represents primordial regeneration. Even his garb shifted to reflect this altered balance, and his sword was spontaneously reforged. Doing what came naturally to him, like an amnesiac recovering lost memories, Siegfrund knit the sorcerer’s flesh back together and anchored the sorcerer’s swiftly-departing soul to it. Restored to life, the necromancer tutored Siegfrund on Teleria and its history. At last Siegfrund began to gain a dim but growing awareness of what he truly was, and to wonder for the first time if he could have a place in the world.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8220#static": "The story of Gharol Bloodmaul begins in the bloody months of slaughter that followed the failed invasion of Kaerok by the Gaellen Pact. Gharol’s clan wandered for years, assuming a nomadic existence. Eventually, they found a place to call their own: an oasis in the Krokhan Desert. Surrounded by stony crags and trackless wastes, the water was nonetheless pure and cool, the soil around was rich and fertile, and wild game was plentiful. The Orcs built a new life for themselves, isolated from all those who might wish them harm.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, they lived in peace, but they never forgot the lessons of war; the clan maintained a readiness for battle, though many hoped never to have to fight again. It was into this idyllic if somewhat hardscrabble life that Gharol was born.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the clan chieftain, Gharol grew to adulthood knowing that she was destined to lead her people. But she desired more. Weaned on the tales of the Gaellen War, and the heroes of old, Gharol desired to taste the fruits of battle for herself. \r\n\r\nWhen she at last assumed the mantle of chieftain, Gharol gathered a band of young warriors around her and led raiding parties against the Nomads that roamed the desert. Soon, she set her sights on the trade caravans of Velyzar and Ireth. This was to be her undoing, and the undoing of her clan.\r\n\r\nWhen Gharol made an attack on a particularly tempting slave-caravan bound for Ireth, she and her band found themselves outmatched for the first time. They were driven back by Undead guards, who felt neither pain nor fatigue, as well as the dark magic of the sorcerers who controlled them. Orcs were seared to ashes or combusted into clouds of blood. Many were captured. \r\n\r\nGharol and her remaining warriors retreated to the safety of the oasis, but the mage-lords of Ireth had no intention of letting potential specimens get away. They questioned those Orcs they captured and forced them to reveal the location of their home. The mage-lords acted quickly. Picturing the oasis in their mind's eyes, they turned the water of its many pools into foaming, fiery blood, from which Undead warriors erupted by the score, attacking the inhabitants. \r\n\r\nTaken by surprise, the Orcs nonetheless fought bravely in defense of their homes and families. But they were no match for the Undead horde. After a fierce conflict, Gharol’s clan was reduced to a few bloodied individuals, captured for the amusement of Ireth’s mage-lords, including Gharol herself. \r\n\r\nGharol and her fellow captives endured months of torture at the hands of their captors. The mage-lords conducted experiments to test the limits of the Orcs’ endurance and strength. One by one, Gharol’s companions succumbed to their captors’ attentions and perished, until only she remained. \r\n\r\nGharol could not say whether her survival was due to some twist of fate, or her own resilience, but it did not come without a price. The alchemical experiments of her captors had taken their toll on her body, changing it in strange ways. \r\n\r\nWhen angered or hurt, Gharol's blood burned like fire and became mutable. Her musculature swelled, she sprouted a thick, whip-like tail and bony protrusions erupted from her flesh, forming a carapace that merged with the tattered armor she still wore. Her feet twisted into hooves, and her features warped into a monstrous visage. To say her captors were pleased was an understatement. The only flaw from their perspective was that Gharol returned to normal after a period of time. But they were certain that with further experimentation they could prevent this. \r\n\r\nThey would not get the chance. Gharol was not idle in her captivity. After some experimentation of her own, she found that she could channel her fury and pain and willingly activate the transformation, by slicing her flesh and spilling her own flame-blood. She hid this discovery from her captors and ceased her resistance, so that they came to believe she was broken in both mind and spirit. As a result, the guards became lax in their duties, seeing her as just another cowed slave. She gave them no trouble as they escorted her to and from the laboratories of the mage-lords day in and day out, until they ceased paying attention to her entirely. \r\n\r\nGharol seized her chance. One day when the guards came to take her to the laboratories, she transformed. Gharol smashed the life from the guards and used her great hooves to kick herself a path to freedom over their mangled corpses, claiming an immense hammer from one and coating it in her magma-like life-force to lend it even more might. She then freed other captives in the slave-pens, Orc, Human, and otherwise, and a general revolt ensued, in which Gharol messily slew many guards and, in the confusion, escaped with as many of the slaves as would follow her.\r\n\r\nGharol led her ragtag band of survivors out of Ireth and into the desert. She guided them to the oasis where her clan had made their home, hoping that it would provide them a refuge as it had her people once before, and ordered her sorcerers to ensure never again could the oasis waters be used by the necromancers. Since then, she has drawn others to her banner: Orcs, Skinwalkers, and Ogryn seeking a strong leader and a place to settle; Nomads, hoping to plunder the riches of Ireth, and other escapees. Her tiny band has swelled into an army; one with the potential to be a true threat to the authority of Ireth.\r\n\r\nIn the months since, Gharol and her forces have defeated no fewer than three expeditions sent to capture or destroy them, leading to much consternation among the mage-lords. So much so, in fact, that some claim that Vizier Ovelis himself has now taken an interest in the matter. \r\n\r\nRegardless, Gharol Bloodmaul now prepares her new clan for all-out war against Ireth, and woe betide any who stand in her way…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8230#static": "Sylvan legends tell of Arbais the Stonethorn, a beautiful yet terrible Fae who stalks the darkest groves and dangerous frontiers of the Mistwood. Before she was a part-petrified and embittered shadow of her former self, she began her existence as an altogether more peaceful and harmonious entity.\r\n\r\nArbais’ seedling chrysalis grew up alongside the ancient Heart Tree near the center of the Mistwood, sharing soil and sunlight with the mighty sentinel. When she was old enough, she dragged up her roots and walked for the first time. She went abroad through the forest, learning its ways and her place within it, communing with birds and beasts, boughs and bark. While she made all of the great woodland her home, she returned often to the Heart Tree’s side, settling her roots back where she had first grown, intertwining them with the other’s. The Heart Tree was as a mother, a wise and protective spirit whose Rhythm sang Arbais to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she slumbered, Arbais did so for many years, and during one such period things changed. A darkness, spread by the servants of Siroth, erupted from the Heart Tree. Slowly it twisted and subverted the ancient core of the forest and distorted the Rhythm. Arbais’ sleep became more fitful and disturbed. As her dreams turned to nightmares, she started awake and discovered, to her horror, that they were not merely her imagination.\r\n\r\nThe Heart Tree had been corrupted. Evil wormed through its bark and rotted its leaves. Worse, the taint had spread into Arbais’ own body, her timber now lousy with the Darkness of Siroth. Sickened and repulsed, she tried first to commune with the Heart Tree, to warn it, to make it all stop, but it showed no recognition. Growing desperate, she called to the surrounding trees, but they were tainted too. Panicking, she physically tried to scour away the corruption from the Heart Tree, but found herself breaking and snapping parts of it to no avail – the taint had delved too deeply. As her own agony built and she felt the contagion burrowing into her, Arbais realized that there was only one way she could preserve herself from the foulness – physically separate herself from the tree she had once adored above all else.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty, Arbais tore her roots away from the Heart Tree’s, weeping with pain and sorrow, her whole frame shuddering. They had grown even more entwined during the years she had spent in slumber, and in freeing herself she ripped away part of the older tree, while at the same time leaving behind part of herself.\r\n\r\nArbais stumbled away, in a haze of anguish and agony, her lament sending shivers through swathes of the forest. Her survival remained uncertain, as the act of separation had almost come too late. Cut off from the nourishment of the Heart Tree, her bark began to petrify. Only through her connection to the wider forest was she able to cling onto life – she planted herself for a while in the Whispering Glade and embraced the sunlight there, and her roots drank of the cool, renewing waters of the Greenrun Stream. Slowly her life-force became constant and steady again.\r\n\r\nAs she recovered, Arbais discovered the fragment of the Heart Tree that had been torn away with her roots. Rather than destroy it, she kept it, her attuned nature telling her that though it would be forever damaged, the evil it had once borne had been left behind when she ripped it free. The Rhythm still emanated from it, albeit disjointed, and was a reminder of a happier past and a horrifying present.\r\n\r\nAll of the Mistwood was threatened by the corruption of the Heart Tree, and when the forces of the Sylvan and their allies, the Skyiron Dwarves and Shadowkin rebels of Yakai, finally mustered for the final time to halt it once and for all, they were joined by a beautiful, masked woman with flesh as emerald as the forest canopy who was wrapped in gossamer cloth, and who spoke with a voice like the rushing of the wind in the leaves. Arbais could change her form, and when she joined the Sylvan Elves who comprised part of the army’s vanguard, she assumed one that they might empathize with more.\r\n\r\nDuring the fighting that followed, Arbais struggled unlike anyone else. The sight of the Heart Tree, warped almost beyond recognition after decades of further corruption, filled her with a fury she had never known before. She led the assault on the corrupt Fae, Demonspawn, and the Mikage Autocracy forces that were using the tree as a locus, plunging her roots into their bodies and draining the life from them, her whip-vines severing heads and limbs. She set about slaughtering the maddened, tainted Fae that assailed her, ripping out their wings and staving in their shrieking features. She wept bitter tears of amber sap, and transformed back into her original, tree-like form as she fought. Her stony bark was impervious to the blows of beings she had once counted as family, whom she uprooted to clear a path toward the Heart Tree itself. The struggle to purge the Darkness from it was even more painful than tearing herself away from it for Arbais, but by the end, Siroth’s evil was cast out.\r\n\r\nWhile the Heart Tree’s remains were no longer being defiled by the Shadow God, the taint could not be reversed. Arbais could never again peacefully settle among its roots, which were now gouged and charred, or drink from soil upon which now lay the rotting remains of countless fallen warriors. Her soul felt as hollow as the dead husks of the trees of the battle site. For a time after she wandered the forest, tracking down lingering remnants of the evil forces. Now, known as Arbais the Stonethorn, she spends years at a time planted at single sites along the border, ever watchful for intruders.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8240#static": "Myths begin with a kernel of truth, even if it is tiny. The myth that Skinwalkers are influenced by the moon originates with Mezomel Luperfang, scion of moonlight – though most Telerians are unaware of her tale. After generations of misunderstanding and exaggeration, many wrongly believe Skinwalkers go mad in the light of the full moon, and transform, becoming hulking, monstrous distortions of their basic forms. Bitter Skinwalkers claim that the myth of Skinwalker moon-madness is spread because it encourages mob violence against their kind during the full moon, when a murderous throng can see more clearly at night and find innocent Skinwalkers to lynch. Such tactics were commonly used during the Red Crusade, and tales and images of moonlight battles between Skinwalkers and hunters contributed to the misconception. But there is yet that kernel of truth: Mezomel Luperfang, the Skinwalker who sold her allegiance to the Fae Duke of Moonlight.\r\n\r\nMezomel was once a Human living an itinerant lifestyle and doing odd jobs in the land of Yakai. One day, Mezomel was lured out of town and into a thicket by a paramour. Her partner playfully ran from her into the woods and Mezomel followed, but the two became separated. Mezomel searched, assuming it a lighthearted jest, and followed distant cries from her lover, who seemed to lead her on a chase. Following the call led Mezomel to a series of animals, first a fox, then a deer, and finally an owl, but not to her partner. Growing exasperated, Mezomel shouted her frustrations and demanded her partner come forth – and what emerged from behind a broad ginkgo tree was a spitting image of herself. She froze stiff as the doppelganger spoke in her lover’s voice. Her duplicate became the fox she had seen, then the deer and owl, and then her lover, before it finally assumed its true form. She was face to face with a kitsune of folklore, a fox-eared woman who radiated cold beauty. The kitsune announced herself as Hazen-Shu. Mezomel asked why Hazen-Shu had lived in disguise in town, and teased and flirted with her. Hazen-Shu only laughed and twirled on her heels, and ran in her true shape through the woods. Mesmerized and even more confused than before, Mezomel followed as fast as she could. In her haste, she lost her footing and fell, tumbling down a hillside and crashing into a den of wolves. \r\n\r\nThat was a fateful moment, for Mezomel’s body crushed several pups and injured the mother, who attacked her at once. Flushed with adrenaline, Mezomel killed the animal with her dagger. She was struck by the Skinwalker curse, and became a wolf-like creature herself, an agonizing process. She grew equally infuriated and obsessed with Hazen-Shu, whom she felt certain had arranged everything that had happened to her, including the wolves and her transformation. Kitsune were known to be merciless tricksters. \r\n\r\nBut Mezomel could not easily track down a shapeshifter. She wandered alone, searching listlessly, and found herself near the Mistwood. The moon was full one night, and she could not sleep, so sat and brooded on a hilltop. There, she was besought by one of the Fae Court: the Duke of Moonlight, a powerful and utterly mysterious being, holder of great but ineffable power within the incomprehensible politics of the Fae, and wielder of lunar magic. Tales say he appears as an Elf, a scintillant white bull, or even as a silver puppet on strings of moonlight.\r\n\r\nThe Duke explained that Hazen-Shu was aligned with one of his great rivals, the Prince of Reeds. Why Reeds and Moonlight should stand opposed was not Mezomel’s place to question. He offered her revenge, and answers, if she accepted his suzerainty. She would become Fae-touched, unlike all other Skinwalkers, and share the Duke’s connection to the Rhythm – but only in the aspect of the moon, the Duke’s domain. In exchange, she would be his knight and strive against his enemies, and thereby find her chance to confront Hazen-Shu. Mezomel agreed to the bargain, seeing her place in mortal society as already tenuous. They say that the Duke of Moonlight anointed her with dust gathered from the moon itself, and the pact was sealed. Her lupine body grew larger, stronger, and faster. Her limbs and claws elongated, her skin toughened and her fur grew denser. For a few moments she reveled in a surge of newfound strength. Then, clouds obscured the moon, the Duke vanished, and Mezomel returned to her normal Skinwalker self – but it would not be long before she was called upon once again. \r\n\r\nFor an unnaturally long span of years, Mezomel did the Duke’s bidding by moonlight. When beneath those cold rays she could channel the Duke's blessing, becoming filled with terrifying strength and ferocity enabling her to fight like a one-beast army. Confessor Grolus, a Skinwalker-hating demagogue of the Sacred Order, led a party to track her down, only for Mezomel to crush his heavy plate armor like an eggshell and leave him a pile of mangled organs and snapped ribs. The Prince of Reeds once sent his servant Archelon, a wise and ancient snapping turtle the size of a house, to deal with Mezomel – she bit into Archelon’s neck and ripped its head from its body, and feasted on the meat within its massive shell. These and other savage exploits sowed the seeds of a million tall tales of Skinwalkers being touched by the moon. \r\n\r\nBut as to her fateful reunion with Hazen-Shu, and the end of Mezomel’s legend, accounts do not agree. Some say the Prince of Reeds was too canny and kept Hazen-Shu well-hid. Others say Mezomel eventually realized she had been tricked again, and that the Duke of Moonlight had discarded his end of the bargain sometime over the decades. And yet others say Mezomel and Hazen-Shu did meet again, but the outcome of that encounter is lost, or was occluded by the Fae themselves.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8250#static": "When the tides of battle ran irrevocably against Siroth at the close of the Second Great War, many Demonspawn in Teleria turned their swords on themselves, knowing that slaying their host bodies would see them swiftly returned to Anathraad. Not all did so, however.\r\n\r\nOne Demonspawn prince named Heldire was convinced by his subordinate, a Demonspawn named Mikage Jorogumo, to continue the Shadow God’s work in secret. Mikage was an old and cunning being who held a particular affinity for arachnids, whose patience, intelligence, and deadly temperament she honored with her own spider-like form. Cunning, she could weave traps both physical and political, and though rarely seen was often present during the destruction of her enemies, watching from the shadows. Heldire, who had steadily been falling under Mikage’s charming sway, consented to her scheme, and his underlings dispersed, beginning a period of more covert action against the peoples of Teleria. Heldire, Mikage, and a number of Demonspawn ventured into the Human-dominated Dawnlands of Yakai, intending to corrupt what they could not directly conquer. Taking on Human forms, they infiltrated positions of power across the region and rapidly began subverting the clans living there.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mikage had long coveted Yakai. It was distant enough from the Eternal Citadel to ensure the Sacred Order would not meddle in her designs, and gave her a location to one day strike the Arbiter’s Tower from. She had also been working to secretly undermine Heldire’s standing among his warriors almost since the beginning of the Second Great War. After taking on the role of a trusted advisor within several prominent Dawnlander clans, Mikage exposed Heldire’s Demonic form, convincing the Humans to attack the stronghold he had been building at Kumoshiro. Covertly, Mikage mixed the paralyzing venom she could excrete into the garrison’s water supply, leaving Heldire and his minions powerless to defend themselves. The Humans slaughtered them. Thus did Mikage further cement the trust she had earned from the witless Dawnlanders.\r\n\r\nMikage likewise used Heldire’s destruction as an example to other Demonspawn, showing those who resisted her authority that she could expose them to the Humans now in her thrall. She set about weaving more webs among the clans, rapidly subverting them. Nobles were seduced, old pacts broken, and within the space of just a few years swathes of Yakai had sworn themselves to the beautiful woman they knew as Lady Mikage, with Heldire’s original servants soon hugely outnumbered by those Mikage had turned.\r\n\r\nWhat became known as the Mikage Autocracy quickly held sway in eastern Peltas, beginning a reign of terror that lasted for centuries. Lady Mikage pleased Siroth with a foretaste of what could come for all Teleria, creating a kingdom where Demonspawn ruled and their mortal underlings inflicted all manner of brutalities on any who would not swear obeisance. Kumoshiro became her powerbase, and her capital – she filled its throne room with thick webs and entangled within them the desiccated corpses of those who had displeased their spider queen.\r\n\r\nBut Mikage did not grow indolent in victory. Like the arachnids she loved to mimic and control, she knew it was best if her prey were unaware that she sat at the center of her web, blind to her presence until it was too late. She was rarely present at Kumoshiro, preferring instead to walk abroad, her true and terrible form concealed using the beatific, magical mask she wore. She continued to subvert and corrupt, and her influence scuttled down into even the lowest layers of Yakai society.\r\n\r\nBesides the many mortals who did her bidding, Mikage also wove dark magics around a great number of spiders, giving some the ability to metamorphosize into human form. In this way these servants could travel abroad and spread her influence further, spinning more traps to catch spies and traitors and lure in the unwary, their true nature only hinted at by the web tattoos found on parts of their bodies, their unblinking stares, and their swift but silent tread.\r\n\r\nWhile the Autocracy grew powerful and Lady Mikage all-but omnipotent thanks to her minions and spiderlings, eventually the brutality of Yakai’s rulers pushed the common people too far. A rebellion began, spreading like wildfire among the lower classes and eventually receiving support from the likes of the Sylvan of the Mistwood and the Dwarves of the Skyiron Dominion. Armed conflict erupted throughout Yakai, as the forces of the Autocracy fought to suppress what turned into a vicious guerrilla campaign.\r\n\r\nLady Mikage turned her talents to the destruction of the rebellion, and almost succeeded. She tricked and seduced many of its leaders, sending their forces into ambushes, or luring them to Kumoshiro’s dungeons. But the uprising proved bigger for any one being to contain, even one as fiercely cunning and terrifyingly ruthless as Lady Mikage.\r\n\r\nAs more Autocracy strongholds fell and more people joined the rebellion, Lady Mikage’s efforts became ever-more desperate. She withdrew entirely from direct leadership of the Autocracy, leaving her web throne in Kumoshiro unoccupied as she lurked in the shadows elsewhere in Yakai. She became even more of a legend than she had been before, and some denied that she had even existed at all. This suited her well, for when Kumoshiro was finally burned and the last of her great webs were immolated, the rebellion’s leaders chose to claim that Mikage had perished in the flames, rather than admit that she had evaded them.\r\n\r\nSince that defeat, Lady Mikage has haunted Yakai, like a nightmare that refuses to fully dissipate with waking. She carefully conceals her true, arachnid form, taking the guise of a masked noblewoman or poor traveler as need takes her. She knows she cannot return to Anathraad, for her failure to aid Siroth in the Third Great War while failing to control Yakai would see her grievously punished by the Shadow God. So she remains in the shadows, a fallen ruler who, with the slow but diligent patience of a spider, is carefully weaving her broken web anew.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8260#static": "From his earliest days, Bambus was a vivid dreamer. His dreams brought him both joy and concern, for the dreams of Telerians are a common doorway for supernatural forces to influence one’s mind and soul. Over the centuries, sleepers have reported seeming encounters with the gods, the Fae, powerful Demonspawn, the Arbiter, and other mysterious entities. Some receive revelations, some compulsions, others are outright controlled. Not all such tales are credible, but overall the phenomenon is widely accepted among Telerians. That is why Teleria’s many cultures each developed numerous customs and rituals related to sleep – prayers, tokens, and rites to keep a sleeper’s dreams safe or enable a sleeper to tap into the power of dreams. This body of lore always fascinated the young Bambus. \r\n\r\nBut Bambus was a hard-working Ogryn longshoreman in a busy Yakai port, loading and unloading commercial goods and the spoils of expeditions to the Lost Isles and beyond. He had little time to sleep, but dreamt richly when he did, inhabiting a dream-world that he had been exploring and shaping since childhood. In the land of dreams, his best friend was a talking panda called Hocho, a little bear who never grew up. Hocho was clever and kind, if somewhat cowardly. Together, they had many fine adventures and explored fantastical dream-realms, the memories of which satisfied Bambus through his long days of hard labor in the waking world.\r\n\r\nOver the course of months, troubling omens crept into Bambus' dreams. Dark clouds grew larger on the far horizons of the dreamscape. The inhabitants of the various dream-kingdoms became cold and alien; in the end only faithful Hocho remained to guide him. Bambus searched the dreamworld for the source of this malignant feeling, but no matter where he went, the evil emanation always seemed nearby, but out of reach. \r\n\r\nWhile this unfolded in his sleep, during the day Bambus still worked the docks, and from sailors and merchants he overheard reports of unease and radicalism among the Elves of distant Anhelt. Bambus never cared about the politics and cultures of the waking world, and paid it little mind, until a name emerged: the ‘Dreamwalker.’ It was said that Elves were being seduced into a cult led by this enigmatic figure – or, to hear others tell it, that a peaceful spiritual movement promising liberation and equality was being tyrannically persecuted. Either way. it was a being called the Dreamwalker at the center of the drama. This ignited Bambus’ curiosity and suspicion. \r\n\r\nBambus went with Hocho to the top of the highest peak of his fantastical world and shouted to the Dreamwalker to reveal and explain himself. After this he began to hear a faint, wicked laughter growing louder and louder and the skies above the mountain peak darkened as Bambus and Hocho stood side by side ready to defend their world. \r\n\r\nBambus has no memory of encountering the Dreamwalker, or anyone else – only a terrible blank. He awoke in a bamboo grove outside of town, wracked with pain, and he saw by moonlight that his body was no longer as it was. He was a clawed and hairy humanoid panda, and the terror of awakening in this altered shape scarcely had time to set in before Bambus saw another horrific sight before him: a young panda, dead. Aflame with fear and guilt, he returned to the bunkhouse where he lodged. He dared not admit to his fellows there what he had become, but he asked about who he had been. He was told that an Ogryn called Bambus indeed lodged there but had left hours ago on a listless walk out of town.\r\n\r\nBambus had sleep-walked into becoming a Skinwalker. He was certain he had been perversely forced to slay the panda and trigger the curse by the awful being who roamed Teleria in the guise of the Dreamwalker. Desperate for answers, he indentured himself to a merchant company in exchange for passage to Anhelt. He yearned to confront the so-called Dreamwalker in the real world, but what gnawed at him most was the fate of his own dreamworld – for ever since that terrible night, his sleep was empty and meaningless, and he had no idea what had become of his beloved companion Hocho.\r\n\r\nWhile serving two years in servitude at sea, Bambus trained with the sailors to learn to fight, and drew on his knowledge of sleep-lore to prepare soporific concoctions in a large, distinctive bottle that he could use in battle to knock an enemy unconscious. Afterward he was deposited at an Aravian port and made his way to Durham Forest – but Bambus faded from history thereafter and the secretive Dark Elves are silent as to his fate.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8270#static": "In Kaerok's Barony of Mochmargen, at the Baron Marghart’s pastoral estate, lived two Ogryn brothers, Toglurr and Wakron. Toglurr was the older, though smaller in stature: clever and level-headed, but gruff. He had a knack for cuisine, and served as the estate’s head chef. Wakron, the younger brother, simple-minded but kind, was Toglurr’s provisioner, in charge of gathering ingredients. In contrast to his older sibling, he was a hulking figure. He retrieved vegetables, cheeses, dried meats, and grains from the fields and root cellars to meet the constant demands of Toglurr’s kitchen. He was also a skilled butcher, but that was the limit of what he could accomplish with his meager intellect. Toglurr scolded Wakron when the younger Ogryn misbehaved or misunderstood an order, but was also his biggest advocate. Toglurr insisted that he would not work without Wakron by his side.\r\n\r\nOne year, Baron Marghart invited a scholar-mage to the estate to advise him on the use of spellcraft to increase his farm's productivity. This wizard, Lahzarc, was disliked by the staff. His humor was dark and disturbing, and his air was dour and faintly predatory. When not muttering incantations over pregnant sows and tracing arcane glyphs into seedbeds, Lahzarc roamed the grounds eyeing the servants, sometimes smirking mysteriously as if at some imagined jest at that person’s expense. While Lahzarc was permitted to magically experiment on plants and animals, the Baron warned him to cast no spells upon people, on pain of death. But the servants feared Lahzarc nonetheless, and held little faith in his promises. \r\n\r\nAfter weeks of residency, having achieved some modest improvements upon crops and livestock by his spells, Lahzarc’s interest turned to the Ogryn brothers. Their personalities and their loving but fractious working relationship, fascinated him. He approached them both in turn to converse, and they were obliged by their status as servants to make at least a perfunctory reply to him, their guest. In passing, Toglurr told Lahzarc he wished his brother was easier to keep an eye on. Having just bungled a task, Wakron mentioned wishing he could have his clever brother always there to advise him. Lahzarc, that enigmatic grin again upon his face, thanked them for their time.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Lahzarc could no longer please himself with plants and animals. A sickness was in him, a sociopathic and detached curiosity. It was trivial for Lahzarc to lure Wakron to a little-used barn and stun him with a burst of stupefying magic. Toglurr arrived later, searching for his missing brother, and Lahzarc likewise ensorcelled him into a comatose state, then began his ghastly work upon the two Ogryn. \r\n\r\nLahzarc weaved his spell more strongly, so that the brothers were all but dead, their hearts stopped and their minds frozen, sustained only by a trickle of magic. Then, with the tools of the barn and some of his own personal equipment and supplies, Lahzarc chopped them apart while they yet lived, and reassembled their components. The smaller Toglurr was largely discarded, but his head would certainly be quite useful on Wakron’s hulking frame. Easier to control... always properly guided… surely, thought Lahzarc, he had created a far superior servant.\r\n\r\nThe scholar-mage was discovered within hours, spattered in Ogryn blood, but it was time enough for his macabre experiment to succeed. He did not flee when the screams of horror roused the attention of the baron’s men-at-arms, and did not resist when they dragged him to the dungeons. Instead, he raved with praise at the magnificence of his own creation, and confidently awaited the Baron’s pardon. Instead he was stripped and searched, and upon his breast was discovered the brand-scar of dread Ireth, city of mad flesh-twisters and necromancer-princes. Such a brand was the mark of a failed student and exile from that abominable place. Lahzarc was swiftly put to death and his body burned, on charge of murder and dark magic. \r\n\r\nBut what of the Ogryn brothers? Unbeknownst to the baron and his troops, the Ogryn's two-headed body survived, flesh knitted together and regenerated by Lahzarc’s mad biomancy. But their individual minds had not withstood this horrific rebirth. No longer Toglurr and Wakron, the new entity that called himself Togron emerged from the scraps of the two Ogryn’s personalities. In the chaotic weeks that followed, Baron Marghart fell from grace and inquisitors of the Sacred Order swarmed the estate to ensure Lahzarc’s madness was totally purged. But they were thwarted – the servants had helped Togron flee out of fondness for who the brothers had been, and sympathy for what they had become. It is said Togron now hides in the ruins of Narbuk, still equipped with his giant cooking tools, hunting rats and other creatures. Perhaps on some level, he remembers his old talents.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8280#static": "Vitrius was an orphan of the Arena City of Velyzar, a place where true piety is scarce and coin rules all. Though the Sacred Order is not popular there, it maintains a fortified mission-building and several smaller shrines, and it was in these places the young Vitrius found peace, safety, and brotherhood. Chronically lacking funds and with minimal official support, the Order in Velyzar attempted to stay abreast of the creeping evil that heralded the start of Siroth’s Third Great War. While the bloody Gaellen War raged on, more and more Undead attacks were reported around the world, and ominous rumblings came from the Dark Elves of Durham and the Demonspawn warlords of the Mikage Autocracy. Siroth was stirring, mustering for battle.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the Arbiter’s power was greatly weakened compared to that which she wielded during the first two Great Wars, and was forced to use dream-sendings and mundane communications to call forth defenders. But her call reached few receptive ears. Generations had passed since Siroth’s last failed attempt to seize Teleria for his own. Many mortals had begun to view the possibility of a third invasion as a low priority compared to worldly threats. There were even those who doubted the Arbiter herself, believing that she had vanished once and for all. But Vitrius was not among them.\r\n\r\nOne night as Vitrius slept a troubled sleep, he heard the Arbiter’s voice in a dream and saw her form, if but faintly. She told him the unease of the land was indeed Siroth’s doing, and the time had come once again for the mortal world to defend itself. Vitrius was awed and humbled that his faith was rewarded by such a visitation. He instantly agreed to take up arms, but told the Arbiter that he lacked gleaming armor and magnificent weaponry worthy of her. The Arbiter replied to worry not, for his righteous heart made him worthy of being called her Anointed – and then Vitrius awoke. It was dawn, and he stood within a local smithy. Resting upon its anvil was a set of plate armor and a huge broadsword. The weapon was wrapped in ribbons of holy scripture, and crowning the armor was a halo of exquisite stained glass. Vitrius was no metal worker, and the materials had not come from within the smithy – the forge master, when she arrived and accused Vitrius of thievery, found nothing missing from her stock. Vitrius claimed the materials had been sent from the Halls of Eternity and that the Arbiter had guided his hands.\r\n\r\nInspired by this miracle, the smith agreed to donate arms and armor to the mission. Vitrius gave them to those who wished to crusade with him, and together they departed Velyzar. A mass of Undead, commanded by a mummified revenant, were reportedly gathering nearby, and Vitrius led his comrades against them. They won a great victory, but quickly took up arms once again when Demonspawn armies appeared in the Stormwind Wastes and Krokhan Desert. Vitrius and his crusaders won renown, and the Sacred Order called him to arms in support of the Telerian League, which was planning its final assault on the Sorrowlakes. But Vitrius refused to abandon a holy war to spill secular blood.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, it became clear that Siroth’s invasion had failed to coalesce. Instead of marching to battle, the oppressed levies of the Mikage turned on their overlords and began a prolonged insurrection. The Dark Elves intensified their raids, but these were indecisive. The Knights Revenant, seeing Siroth struggle with loyalty and unity for the first time when once his word was law, dragged their feet. Even many Demonspawn refused to fight. This left only the Undead. They alone, given the ongoing devastation of the Gaellen War, could have been enough to do lasting harm. But Siroth could not control them all simultaneously, and thus could not unite them. And thanks to the efforts of Vitrius, and the many like him who could yet hear the Arbiter’s call over the clamor of war, they were thwarted.\r\n\r\nOnly when Vitrius was confident that Siroth’s invasion had ended and the Arbiter’s will was fulfilled did he and his knights help conclude the Gaellen War. In three years, the war ended with the sack of the City of Dreams and bitter defeat for the Gaellens, and Vitrius returned to Velyzar praying for peace upon the war-exhausted world. But Siroth never sleeps, and his corruption never ceases to bubble up, even while he nurses defeat. Knowing this, Vitrius swore not to lay down his arms but to continue ceaselessly purging the creatures of Darkness. Rumors of growing terrors were flying upon his return, and if Vitrius has his way, they would all fall before his purifying, hymn-shrouded blade.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8290#static": "The tale of Pann weaves through hill and dale, fen and field, wherever nature’s endless growth rubs against the boundaries of civilization. His joys are revelry and the hunt, sensual lust and sensory overload, a nomadic existence without regard for borders or societies. He is said to make mortals dance to death, to drink and share tales with him for a night that really lasts a month, to lose their senses and join in wild chases across the landscape after any prey imaginable. To see his iconic pair of horns silhouetted against the moonlit sky is to invite a rush of thrill and dread. For their recurved shape he is called the Bowhorn, and he is indeed a master of the bow and the blade as well. Pann is a Fae, and his origin and affiliations are unknown. He has been tied to various magnates of the Fae Court as an agent, or even an avatar. Equally, he described as a wild spirit unmoored from loyalty to anyone or anything. \r\n\r\nPann certainly does not brandish any allegiances openly. However, he does have a fierce sense of justice, although, as with most Fae, it does not always resemble that of mortals. Pann is a protector of the wildlands, an ambassador and guardian of their ominous yet enticing unspoiled mysteries. Though he hunts wild beasts with reckless zeal, he protects the habitat in which these creatures dwell so he may yet hunt again. Loggers and herdsmen who overburden forests and fields may face retribution from Pann in the form of vandalism, sabotage, and intimidation. He rarely resorts to violence, preferring humiliation or deprivation as punishments. Woodland trespassers have been found vast distances away, and claim they were led on a frantic chase for league after impossible league, their feet compelled to follow a fleeting caprine figure. Separately, groups of clear-cutting loggers, drinking and feasting by night amid the stumps of their conquests, have been known to be visited by a boisterous and irrepressible party guest. But after a night of carousing, the workers awake bleary in the dawnlight to find their saws warped into contorted lumps of useless metal, their pack animals set loose to wander far afield, their provisions reduced to crumbs, and their every article of clothing stolen. \r\n\r\nOften, the revels Pann holds with his friends are indistinguishable from the terror tactics he uses on his enemies. But he has been pressed into combat before by particularly irate despoilers of nature, and has shown that his skill is not limited to bringing down game. His goatish legs give him amazing powers of leaping and balance and with a combination of finesse and heedless abandon he can shoot or slash to threaten a foe at close range or long. Were that the extent of his capability, it would be sufficient to cow most warriors. But Pann’s whistling arrows and keening sword weave subtle Fae enchantments as well, creating the same sort of phenomena that tales attribute to Pann in less combative situations: loss of sense of time, irresistible compulsions, and spontaneous obliteration of all good sense and judgment. In battle, these become mortal dangers.\r\n\r\nPann is associated with the Sylvan of Mistwood, and encountered most often near there. But the Sylvan are planting the seeds of expansion across the globe, and alongside their gradually blooming presence, Pann is said to be frolicking further and further afield.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8300#static": "The man who became the dreaded Soul Shepherd known as Malkith Bloodflock started life as an impoverished student at Kaerok’s great Bibliotheque Spire. An orphan who had been left in the Spire’s care, he had none of the funds or grand lineage of most of his fellow students and, while his book learning and grasp of sorcery was sufficient for his studies, it was far from exceptional.\r\n\r\nMalkith suffered from loneliness and the belittling cruelty of his peers. He found few joys in acts of sorcery, and lacked drive or ambition. That was until, one day, as he was sheltering from his abusers in his meager bedchamber high in one of the Spire’s towers, he noticed a raven striding back and forth across his windowsill.\r\n\r\nHe realized the bird was organizing a collection of stones by size, before clutching the largest in its beak and flying away. Such careful decision making by what Malkith had taken to be a mindless animal surprised and intrigued him.\r\n\r\nOver the next few months, Malkith carefully observed more ravens as they came and went around the Spire, becoming fascinated with their intelligence. He tried to communicate with them using a variety of different spells, to no avail. While unable to speak with the birds directly, he became aware of the broad sweep of their thoughts, and found too that he could influence them.\r\n\r\nWith this power, Malkith began to use the birds to confound his bullies. At first it started relatively innocently – while watching from the window of his chamber, Malkith caused a flock to descend on one arrogant student, ripping her scrolls and books apart and causing her to flee in terror. On another occasion he had them steal an heirloom ring belonging to a classmate who regularly mocked Malkith’s status as an orphan.\r\n\r\nMalkith relished such acts of petty revenge, and started to use the ravens more aggressively. He failed to hide his growing connection to the black-feathered avians, however, so when his ravens pecked an eye of one of his tormentors out, an investigation established that he was behind the airborne terror. He was expelled from the Bibliotheque Spire.\r\n\r\nBlackest despair gripped Malkith. On the night he was to be evicted, he planned to take his own life, but a knock at his door made him pause. One of the Spire’s tutors, Magister Amalphus, had noted Malkith’s abilities. While he could not change the decision of his peers, he offered the youth an alternative. He could become Amalphus’ apprentice, and the magister would teach him how to further his abilities and introduce him to people outside the Spire who would appreciate his gifts and power.\r\n\r\nMalkith accepted, and with time was introduced to the secrets of the hidden society Amalphus was a member of – the Cult of K’Leth. In it, learned to harness greater control over his ravens by ritually cutting both them and himself, and touching the wounds. Amalphus had him unleash them on the cult’s enemies in a blizzard of black wings, talons, and beaks, and over time taught him how he could take the blood spilled or lost by the ravens and use it to cure sickness and heal wounds. He found he could even superheat that same life force, turning it into a searing liquid that could melt flesh and armor. \r\n\r\nMalkith relished such power, and built upon it. He found brotherhood in the Cult, a form of the kinship he had always desperately wanted. He was soon inducted into the Knights Revenant, rising rose to the rank of Soul Shepherd, and now wields a level of violent power he could never have known had he continued slaving for the mages of Kaerok.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8350#static": "Rumormongers theorize that Shu-Zhen the Valorous, the so-called ‘Extra Soldier,’ is a thrill-seeking scion of a wealthy family. In this the rumors are partly correct, but few would believe the truth: Shu-Zhen the Valorous is no less than the daughter of the Sovereign Temu. Known to nearly everyone as Lei, she is something of an idol: warrior-trained and stronghearted, the court beauty and a coveted, choosy potential bride.\r\n\r\nWhen Lei was young, her father Temu told her tales of the rebellion, some eighty years past. He was busy in his duties as one of Yakai’s three ruling Sovereigns, but out of martial pride and a sense of history, he made time to raise his daughter and ensure she trained at arms and studied the principles of harmonious common decency that the anti-Mikage rebels promulgated. Lei grew up around soldiers, for Temu’s seat as Sovereign depended on support from Yakai’s military elites. Lei assumed that she would join the army as well, having been seemingly reared for the role, but tension over the subject built as Temu repeatedly deferred the decision.  \r\n\r\nLei decided that her father wanted her to be raised a soldier but couldn’t bear to make her one. When she confronted him, he cited safety as his reason for hesitating, but she accused him of wanting to control her. Brooding on their argument, Lei concluded that it wasn’t her physical safety her father feared the army would risk, but her political utility. Either she would secure a marriage alliance, or she would be expected to mount a campaign to succeed her father as Sovereign when he aged. She dreaded having to play politics for the rest of her life, and became repulsed by her father’s hypocrisy – had he trained her to don armor and wield a spear never intending her to use those skills, but merely to burnish her image?\r\n\r\nAfter years feeling as if her purpose was denied, Lei had had enough. She snuck out from her luxuriant quarters in her father’s mansion to the nearby armory, pilfered an anonymous, inconspicuous spear and armor, and hid her face with a silk scarf. She made her way into the city, acting the part of a patrolling guard, and it thrilled her. But her true goal was to fulfil what she saw as a soldier’s purpose and help someone in need, and on her second excursion, she got her chance. Lei came across a raging street fight between two gangs, thugs smashing each other through storefronts and flinging furniture. Dozens of constables were arriving to subdue them. As a chaotic three-way fight raged, many guards who were involved later reported having been saved from danger, or dragged, wounded, out of the fray, by a comrade who then disappeared into the melee. Given the intensity of the fighting, they could not recall exactly which of their fellow guards did the heroic deed. But as their reports were compiled alongside the testimonies of apprehended brawlers, the constabulary were puzzled by the many overlapping claims of an unknown person dressed and acting like a soldier, fighting with considerable skill. Everyone involved thought, in the moment, that they were looking at someone who turned out to have been elsewhere. \r\n\r\nLei’s ambitions grew. She told Sovereign Temu that she would be traveling the land visiting the estates of potential suitors. This pleased him, so he did not press further. Thanks to her father’s access to Yakai’s top military planners, Lei learned of an expedition against mountain bandits and secretly intervened. Again, reports after the battle accounted for a mysterious ‘extra soldier.’ Growing bolder, her next venture was to fall in with an expedition patrolling the Mistwood border. When she was questioned by the commanding officer she identified herself as Shu-Zhen, a recent recruit, whose paperwork had been lost in transportation. The suspicious officer promised to get to the bottom of Shu-Zhen’s sudden appearance, but before he could, the patrol was attacked by a rabid dire-bear. Shu-Zhen charged the beast and ran it through, saving the captain’s life. After this, the captain’s suspicions were allayed, and she was hailed a hero by the soldiers. However, she’d given a name, and that name was eventually attached to the ‘extra soldier’ by gossips and state intelligence alike. For some of Yakai's soldiery, the name has become a rallying cry.\r\n\r\nAs scrutiny on her grows and Shu-Zhen walks a dangerous tightrope, she is determined to continue. If she is exposed and scandalizes her father, so be it – as much as she enjoys her freedom, Shu-Zhen will relish the day when her father learns she was out putting her fighting skills to the test and growing a legend of her own right under his nose.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8360#static": "When the conflict between Siroth and Lumaya began, not all Dwarves sided with the latter. Some chose to walk the path of Darkness instead, bending all their malice and ingenuity to Siroth’s cause. Called Painsmiths, they crafted monstrous weapons of war and engines of destruction; black devices powered by the agonies of the damned and evil magic. \r\n\r\nBut at the climax of the Great Divorce, the Painsmiths’ Demonspawn allies were banished from Teleria and they were left to endure the reprisals of their vengeful kin. Those who were not slain were exiled or fled, and found safety in isolation, seeking the most remote peaks for their new lairs.\r\n\r\nFrolni the Mechanist is the last survivor of one isolated clan. His people made their home in the Redspike Mountains, far from the prying eyes of the Dwarves of Gloomdeep Hold. For centuries, Frolni’s clan survived as best they could, growing more debased with every passing year. They clawed iron from the depths of the mountains and used it to craft vile machines which they used to patrol the tunnels and caverns of their territory. They raided the lowlands by night, capturing and enslaving anyone they came across for all manner of twisted experiments.\r\n\r\nWhen Frolni came of age, he eagerly participated in these raids. A budding mechanist, Frolni had a constant need of fodder for his research in applied metallurgy and an overwhelming hunger for new knowledge. Those he took he condemned to a painful existence; some perished soon after, sheathed in coruscating cocoons of brass and iron. Others lingered, their bodies imprisoned within the iron frameworks of Frolni’s experimental war-automatons.\r\n\r\nFrolni was so obsessed with his studies that when prisoners were impossible to acquire, he experimented on his own kin; a taboo, even among the degenerate Painsmiths. Frolni was careful to implicate others in the disappearances of those Dwarves he experimented on, and as a consequence, the dwindling clan became afflicted with suspicion and paranoia to an unsustainable degree. Soon, they turned on one another and hideous war-machines, crafted in the likeness of brass beasts or men of iron, powered by steam boilers and cogwork hearts, clashed in the tunnels they claimed as their own. \r\n\r\nSoon, only Frolni remained. Alone, he prowled the empty halls, plundering the ruined workshops, seeking anything he could make use of for his own research. It was during these scavenging efforts that he located a strange, rune-etched archway. Through trial and error, he learned that the structure was meant to create stable rune-tunnels: magic pathways allowing for quick transit between two locations.\r\n\r\nThanks to this discovery, and after many months of hard work, Frolni was able to take his scavenging efforts farther afield. He prowled the necropoli of the Stormwind Wastes and beneath the dread boughs of Durham Forest, and even through the catacombs beneath the City of Aravia, amassing ever more dark knowledge in the fields of alchemy, metallurgy, and sorcery. \r\n\r\nIt was during this time that Frolni stumbled upon a strange gem in an abandoned laboratory close to Gloomdeep Hold that was waist-high with water. Something about the eerily flickering amethyst stone resonated with him in the deepest recesses of his soul, and he felt compelled to take it. As he gripped the gemstone, his mind became flooded with schema and calculations such as he had never contemplated before. \r\n\r\nFrolni immediately returned to his workshop and set about crafting the wonder he pictured in his head. After sixty days and nights of intensive labor, he had completed a magi-mechanical gauntlet. Compelled by some dark whisper at the back of his mind, he artfully grafted the gauntlet to his arm, so that it could never be removed. As he stared at his creation in wonder, Frolni gripped the amethyst, which he hung around his neck, and growled out an incantation of activation composed of a single word in his clan’s dialect: ‘Pulverize’. \r\n\r\nIn moments, the plates of a massive suit of baroque armor erupted from the edges of the gauntlet and spread across Frolni's form, encasing him in their protective embrace, and a huge, two-handed ax grew from the metal within his armored hands. He felt filled with a strength such as he had never possessed. But the compulsion of earlier had grown more insistent, becoming impossible to ignore… not that Frolni was inclined to do so. He allowed it to guide him to create a new rune-tunnel and set off on his new quest. \r\n\r\nIn the months since this act of dark creation, Frolni’s expeditions have lost all hint of subtlety as he delves further and deeper in search of something he cannot name. He smashes through every obstacle, living or otherwise, in pursuit of anything he can use to improve the function of his war-armor. His obsession with improving the suit’s function has ensured that in it he is capable of slaying even the largest Jotunn or cave-beast with powerful, bone-crushing blows and he leaves an ever-widening trail of bloody carnage in his wake, wherever his quest takes him. \r\n\r\nRecently, however, Frolni has begun to wonder if he is truly the master of his armor, or if he is simply a host for something more destructive. Each time, it becomes more difficult to shed his armor, as if his creation is resisting him. When he is not encased in it, his entire body aches, as if the gauntlet is sapping his strength to feed itself. \r\n\r\nWorse, more than once Frolni has awakened to find himself clad in his armor and striding through tunnels in the direction of Gloomdeep Hold… as if the armor is responding to a call he cannot hear. Frolni is always quick to return to his lair in these instances, but even so the compulsion that has been guiding him all this time calls out to him from the depths in a voice like that of a crackling flame, demanding that he free it. \r\n\r\nFrolni is convinced that he must eventually do as the voice commands. Otherwise, he fears, the monstrous thing he has created might well never release him from its grasp…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8370#static": "Even before she became the Night Queen, Krixia was a powerful and influential noblewoman. Her husband was a ruling council member – and close advisor to the duke – of the incredibly rich Free City of Jaglon, located on the western coast of Anhelt, which plays host to trade fleets from Yakai, the Mistwood, and the Skyiron Dominion. In all the ways that mattered, Krixia had everything that a person might desire. But she wanted nothing less than an eternity of dominance. Her family crest was a bound woman, held upside down, surrounded with penitent supplicants. She vowed from the day she came of age she would never be bound, never be a penitent, only bowed to and praised.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, Krixia was a woman of great charm and spirit. Wielding an elaborate sword-staff and large shield she battled pirates and bandits. She was a patron of the Church of Lumaya, and a benefactor of the poor. She led efforts to improve the lot of Jaglon’s underclasses and was often consulted by her husband and the duke on matters of social importance. But beneath this noble mask, the truth festered.\r\n\r\nIn private, Krixia felt herself superior to her peers and subjects. She saw no good reason that a woman of her beauty and intelligence should wither and fade. Worse, she feared that her influence would wane with her looks over time, including her hold over her husband. She eagerly consulted with sages and sorcerers in a secretive and increasingly desperate search for the secret of immortality.\r\n\r\nKrixia took every effort to maintain her outward façade of respectability, knowing that her husband would more than frown on her practice of certain rituals designed to preserve youth, including bathing in the blood of young women and inhaling strange concoctions. It was during this time that she attracted the attention of the Cult of K’Leth. One of the sages she consulted was a member of the cult and he was quick to offer her the object of her desire.\r\n\r\nDespite her pragmatism, Krixia cast all wisdom aside in her desperation to be immortal. The Cult promised her the eternity she wanted; in return she simply had to help them acquire more highly-placed members, as well as the resources those members could provide. Krixia readily agreed.\r\n\r\nAs charming as ever, she oversaw the induction of many of her fellow nobles into the Cult. But while she wasn’t the only aristocrat in Jaglon who desired more than their allotted span, she believed herself to be the only one truly worthy of it. Even so, she identified those among her peers who might be susceptible to the Cult’s message as well as those who might become troublesome in the future. She was quick to aim her new allies at old rivals, further cementing her own position.\r\n\r\nBut not every new member was as discreet as Krixia and, in time, their activities attracted the attention of the Sacred Order. Rumors of missing people and dark magic haunted the streets of Jaglon as the Cult’s power waxed. The duke, concerned, invited the Order to investigate and commanded Krixia’s husband to act as his official liaison.\r\n\r\nFor a time Krixia avoided the eye of the inquisitors, and kept the Cult informed about what the Sacred Order was doing and who they planned to do it to. Yet Krixia knew that she could not stay one step ahead forever; if she wished to have any chance to claim the reward the Cult had promised her, she had to ensure the success of their operations in Jaglon.\r\n\r\nThus Krixia, as cunning as she was pragmatic, betrayed her husband for the good of the Cult of K’Leth. She accused him before the representatives of the Sacred Order, blaming him for her crimes she had committed and providing falsified evidence to prove it. Stunned, her husband could mount no defense, and soon burned on an execution pyre, along with a dozen others, all less influential members of the Cult whose loss would mean little to its overall goals.\r\n\r\nVisibly grieved and repentant, Krixia was soon more popular than ever with the citizens of Jaglon and thus it only made sense that, once a suitable amount of time had passed, the duke would take her as his wife. As a wedding gift and a sign of her new husband’s trust, she was given the keys to the city and its treasure vaults.\r\n\r\nMoreover, with the Cult’s support, Krixia began to study magic for herself and found that she had a talent for it and learned how to twist her mortal form into something beautiful and terrible. This winged, angelic form could be manifested with but a word, and it allowed Krixia to spread the faith among the lower classes without worry of being identified as their new duchess. Instead, they spoke only of the ‘terrible angel’, ‘the Night Queen’ or ‘the Lady of the Boneyards’... a holy spirit who came among them to find those worthy of escaping the chill clutch of death forever. She also found that she inspired fear in those who set themselves against the Cult. They saw her as a harbinger of terrible things; a nightmare made flesh, a physical manifestation of its evil.\r\n\r\nIn this guise, Krixia has continued to preach to the poor and downtrodden, expanding the Cult’s reach throughout the lower quarters of the city and beyond. Word of the Night Queen has even reached Yakai, and her fame grows with every passing night as more souls are bound to her by faith and desperation. Her angelic form has further allowed her the freedom to dispatch her enemies in suitably grand fashion, swooping down on them in the dark of the night and striking without mercy, further cementing her reputation as a saint of the Cult of K’Leth. \r\n\r\nBut as Krixia’s power grows, some in the Cult grow fearful of her spreading influence; it is even rumored that K’Leth himself is concerned about her growing popularity among the rank and file. For her part, Krixia wonders whether the Cult will ever make good on its promise. If they do not, she may well take the secret of immortality for herself…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8380#static": "Timit was remarkably tall, broad, and brawny for a Human, nearly as hulking as an Ogryn – or so reckoned a group of traveling performers, when they caught a glimpse of him towering over the crowds at a village harvest festival. They asked him if he would like to accompany them and earn a living as an astonishing physical specimen. Before Timit could answer, his parents told the troubadours that for a sack of seventy copper coins, they could have him, or else six hens, a boar, and a sow. Timit, never a lad with clear or ambitious visions of his own future, shrugged and acquiesced. He bid farewell to his chronically impecunious family and began a new life: Timit, the World’s Largest Madcap, literally the biggest fool in all Teleria. \r\n\r\nIn his new role, Timit wore a jester’s regalia, alongside the ‘slanderer’s collar’ and ‘dunce’s crown’ that peasants were traditionally forced to don in rituals of public humiliation. He would play the perpetual bumbler and butt of every joke. Then, at the end of the show, having been made the laughing stock, Timit the Fool would get his ‘revenge.’ First with his massive size, and then with a clownishly enormous hammer engraved with masques, he would terrify and chase off the rest of the troupe, who would filter out into the audience to solicit money. Then, as a crowd-pleasing finale, Timit used his hammer to smash anything the audience offered up. \r\n\r\nAudiences guffawed at Timit’s humiliations, but cheered nonetheless when he ‘wrestled’ and ‘clobbered’ his former oppressors. The reveal of his giant hammer – which started as a genuine surprise, but grew by reputation to become an open secret among those who flocked to see him – always drew gasps and laughs. And they began to bring all kinds of things that they wanted to see him crush. Huge vegetables, old furniture, sacks of rats, innumerable other oddities – he pulverized them all before the cheering throngs. Given the character of some of the towns and hamlets the troupe visited, Timit’s finale occasionally took a macabre turn. Besides vermin he put down sick or wounded animals, and various people were often put forth as candidates for a squashing, sometimes with frightful sincerity. \r\n\r\nTimit wanted to tone down the smashing ritual, but was pushed to comply with every request for the sake of profit. Eventually, Timit was presented with a so-called witch, whom the townsfolk swore a Sacred Order inquisitor had condemned to death for evil sorcery. They had dragged their heels in obeying his order, and he was therefore long-gone. But the troupe-master held their word as good and their coin as valid, and ordered Timit to be the executioner. Timit hesitated, sweating within his metal cone, hearing the baying crowd ringing and echoing within it. Finally he heeded their chants and crushed the gray-haired woman’s skull with what he hoped was a quick and merciful stroke.\r\n\r\nOn that very night, witch-cursed or maddened with guilt, Timit crept upon the rest of his troupe as they snoozed drunkenly in the village inn. He laid the same execution upon each and every one of them, giving the troupe-master an additional emasculating hammer-strike. Timit fled aimlessly from the discovery and commotion, mulling his resentments and lamenting that he had never known a single loving soul, not his grasping sharecropper parents nor the false family of his troupe. The reasonable and mild-mannered Timit faded away, replaced by a hardened, embittered killer. \r\n\r\nOne fateful night he came to a crossroads and saw, to his amazement, a woman dressed like him, as a fool, in a jangly patchwork of jester’s garb and noble’s plate armor. She laughed aloud when she saw him, and he laughed along with her, two fools driven to wandering madness. She was Kaja the Wry, and Timit became infatuated with her within hours of their meeting. She was the commanding yet sympathetic presence he needed in his life – she treated Timit as a comrade rather than a freak or a bumpkin, and was always coming up with new, amusing diversions for the two of them. He was doggedly devoted to Kaja and her unhinged charisma, and as she pursued her violent prankster’s revenge upon the world that had mistreated them both, Timit wished only to please her. With her leadership and his muscle, they lived a happy life of crime, anarchy, and destruction together. Timit’s colossal hammer found new purpose, shattering the bricks of noble houses and the chains of the enslaved. When the two were pressed in battle, Kaja proved brilliantly distracting with her infuriating jibes, ridiculous gadgets, and outrageous acrobatics – the better to set up a lethal blow from Timit’s slow, ponderous weapon. As they sowed chaos across Anhelt, neither had ever felt more fulfilled.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8390#static": "When she was young, Kaja, heiress of Doeurtine Barony in southeast Kaerok, was told by her doting parents that there was nothing she could not achieve. There was only one kind of thing Kaja absolutely was not allowed to become: an embarrassment and disgrace to Doeurtine. But, it seemed, that was the one and only thing she wanted to be most of all. From the moment she began to speak straight through her violently turbulent teenage years, she questioned and criticized every aspect of her cushioned existence. Tutors, priests, councilors, drillmasters, and her beleaguered parents alike all tried to mold her, and each failed. She mocked Lumayan ritual, and scorned the knights and footmen of her family’s armies, calling them dogs of the state and arbitrary oppressors. She found scholarship crushingly dull, and magic little more than a gimmick. Her short-tempered, gloomy, cutting attitude earned her the name Kaja the Wry, and other, cruder ones, besides. Her parents finally told her she should cease her rebellious and petulant ways or have the title of court jester. \r\n\r\nKaja felt oddly comfortable receiving this ultimatum. Gripped with a passion she had never felt before, she worked in secret with the blacksmiths and seamstresses of the manor to make a grand costume for herself. Part knightly armor, part jongleur getup, part lady’s dress, and part macabre death-mask, she saw it as a pastiche of all the Banner Lords’ overblown, egotistic excesses. She debuted her creation unannounced, interrupting lesser lords petitioning her parents in their great hall. She captured the attention of everyone with her high, clear, commanding voice, improvised dance, table-stomping acrobatics, and the splattering of a melon with her fool’s-head bauble. Her shameless display was so effortlessly compelling that no one interrupted her. After a while, some of the noble plaintiffs grew genuinely entertained by her antics, forgetting the awkwardness of her unwarranted intrusion. It crescendoed with a thorough excoriation of her parents, in which she quoted from the Dwarf Fodbor the Bard’s notorious ‘uses for a scroll roller’ monologue. When she delivered the final punchline, one of the assembled nobles finally let out an unrestrained laugh, and Kaja beamed. \r\n\r\nThe baron rose from his seat, at last finding his tongue, and bellowed that Kaja would be exiled from the barony if she did not immediately apologize. She raged that she had finally accomplished something worthwhile, found meaning and purpose. Crying out again and again that she had really and truly gotten a laugh, she rushed over to a nearby courtier. Unable or unwilling to attack her parents, she displaced her resentment onto him. Kaja beat him savagely before being tackled and dragged off by several guards, and giggled all the way to the dungeons. But after she was shoved into a cell and sternly warned to behave, the household scrambled to contain the repercussions of her scandalous actions and lost focus on her. She played up her apparent madness and pretended to be crazed with lust, luring the lone guardsman left behind to mind her into her cell. She strangled him and retrieved her bloodstained scepter, which had been confiscated. Then she fled her estate, throwing her future away with nihilistic glee, and would thereafter let sheer whimsy be her guide through life. \r\n\r\nAfter some days of wandering, Kaja came upon a crossroads close to Kaerok Castle. Arriving at the same time as her was the hulking misfit Timit the Fool, and when she realized that two vagabonds in jester outfits had randomly crossed paths, she broke into hysterical laughter. Timit laughed too, and so began a legendary, infamous partnership in crime, comedy, and chaos. They both wanted nothing but to thumb their noses at society at large, and neither cared any longer who got hurt in the process. With Kaja’s knowledge of high society and Timit’s massive presence, they terrorized the wealthy and powerful with random, pointless acts of destruction and vandalism. \r\n\r\nOne of their first escapades was toppling a new and expensive equestrian statue set up by one Lord Jurius Vasquon. As Timit cracked the horse’s legs one by one, Kaja stood on top of the bronze Vasquon’s head with perfect balance. When Vasquon’s troops came to apprehend the two, they fought together like madmen, misdirecting and humiliating their opponents with noisemakers and flourishes of confetti before delivering fatal blows. From there, their antics only increased in savagery and ambition. It wasn’t long before Kaja’s resentment turned murderous, and minor nobles were found dead having been killed in creatively gruesome ways: trussed up with their own intestines, gibbeted on their own walls alongside common criminals, or force-fed gold coins and then disemboweled and left to die watching their riches spill forth covered in blood and bile. Baron Doeurtine can only sweat and stew, hoping Kaja does not turn to patricide.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8400#static": "Not all Lizardmen of the Sorrowlakes view their heritage with fondness or pride. The centuries since the defeat of the Gaellen Pact by the Telerian League have seen many Lizardmen clans slip ever-deeper into destitution and internal feuding, beset by poverty and a sense of hopelessness. It is not uncommon for the Pact to be blamed for the current malaise that afflicts many of the clans, whether because it failed to defeat the League, or because it even attempted to fight in the first place. Similarly, the even older legacy of the Dragonkin Empire is spat upon and disdained by many Sorrowlakes clans. Though little is still understood now about the Empire, it is often portrayed as having fallen due to its own arrogance and short-sighted foolishness. The sins of the Dragonkin are still born and paid for by their descendants, so it is claimed, and so the memory of the Empire is despised by many.\r\n\r\nThe self-hatred and bitterness felt by many Lizardmen in the Sorrowlakes is leading to the slow deterioration of the clan structures that have been the bedrock of Lizardmen society for dozens of spawn-generations, but a few have started to harness them as a power in their own right. The warrior known as Krok’mar the Devourer is one such individual.\r\n\r\nKrok’mar is a descendant of the Gaellen Pact general Kron’mor the Great and is physically strong and powerful, a prime example of his species. His thick neck and shoulders, broad gut and gnarled, scaled hide are further accentuated by the old armor of his forebear, heavy pieces of coarse pig-iron and a crest of wicked metal spines that run along his back from his head-plate. In his heavy fists he carries Meatsplitter, a huge wedge of jagged steel that, when wielded with Krok’mar’s strength, can cleave through a Kaerok knight’s armor, body, and the horse he is mounted on with one great blow. He is made even more deadly by the Talons of Kron’mor, a set of metal claws once born by his ancestor that he wears over his left hand.\r\n\r\nKrok’mar’s physical abilities are obvious, but to them he adds a charisma often lacking in coldblooded Lizardmen warrior-types. He is coarse and plain-spoken, and honest and fair in his dealings with others. His anger is a terrifying sight to behold, but it is not easily stoked. While his scars and the metal plates pinning his hacked scales together speak of a brute and a lifelong warrior, Krok’mar is not afraid to negotiate, and knows that there is more to being a leader than mere strength and battle prowess.\r\n\r\nAll of this would imply that Krok’mar has the potential to unite the Lizardmen clans, call upon the legacy of his mighty forefather, and recreate the brief glories of the Gaellen Pact. Anyone who makes such an assumption is making a grave mistake.\r\n\r\nKrok’mar despises his legacy. He hates the Gaellen Pact, believing it damned his people and left them in their current deplorable state. But Krok’mar is not content to wallow in despair. Unlike many other clan leaders and prominent Lizardmen, he will not let the petty rivalries or the unavoidable curse of his ancestry define him. He seeks to rally the clans and free them of the shackles of the past.\r\n\r\nIn this quest, he is uncompromising. He has made himself the sworn enemy of those Lizardmen who still adhere to a belief in the old ways, who still hark back to the Pact or the Dragonkin as legacies to aspire to. This is especially true of the recent influx of Lizardmen refugees fleeing Anhelt due to King Tayba’s War, many of whom often cling to the hope that there is still a chance of renewing the fallen Empire. Krok’mar considers these Lizardmen to be enemies of the Sorrowlakes, whose stupidity will doom the clans to further wars – and thus further defeat. He stirs up other Lizardmen against them and those whom he captures and who refuse to recant, he executes before – to the horror of his enemies – eating their remains.\r\n\r\nFor Krok’mar and his growing band of adherents, this devouring has an important meaning. Thanks to it, the weight of the past is lifted and the failure of the Pact and the sins of the Dragonkin Empire are all undone. To devour is to destroy utterly, and Krok’mar means to destroy more than just the physical bodies of his enemies, but their very ideas and beliefs. Once he has done this in full, and there are none remaining who view the past as something to recreate, he believes the Sorrowlakes will finally be able to move forward, and build something new, something positive that will herald a fresh beginning for his people.",

Intended as fodder for the arenas, Belletar learned to fight, but little else. He might well have ended his days injured and discarded on a midden heap had his owner not been in need of money, and a notorious merchant in need of a caravan guard. \r\n\r\nBelletar was sold to the merchant and chained inside a wagon, with barely enough room to heft his war-club. The young Ogryn was assigned to watch over a delivery of fine silks, bound for Ireth. But the caravan never reached its destination. Instead, it was attacked by Nomad raiders; among them was a towering Ogryn warrior… the infamous Cagebreaker Gruzl Steelbelly. Gruzl discovered Belletar and shattered Belletar’s chains. Confused by this unexpected turn of events, Belletar allowed Gruzl to guide him away from the plundered caravan and into the desert. \r\n\r\nIn the months that followed, Belletar learned a new trade: that of Cagebreaker. Under Gruzl’s stern tutelage, the previously unprepossessing Ogryn became a warrior second only to his mentor. On one raid against a caravan of slaves bound for Ireth, Belletar bit the head off a mage-overseer. As the magically-infused lifeblood of his victim filled his belly, Belletar felt something other than satisfaction. \r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed, Belletar found that he had imbued some of the dead mage’s magical ability, including a gift for healing. But as his skill with this stolen magic grew, his desire to spend his days fighting waned.\r\n\r\nIn time, Belletar took his leave of Gruzl, and the life of a Cagebreaker. While he’d found much satisfaction in freeing others from Velyzar’s cruelty, something told him that his fate lay elsewhere; not as a warrior, but as a shaman. Wishing to fully explore his magical skill undisturbed, Belletar traveled deep into the desert, where even Nomads feared to go. \r\n\r\nThere, in a dying oasis, Belletar spoke with the spirits of the desert and the wastes. As the years passed, he learned how to strengthen a warrior’s flesh and sinew, or drain them of strength, as well as how to draw upon the blessings of the wind and the sand. He took the broken remnants of armor and weapons left behind by fallen travelers and hammered them into a panoply befitting an Ogryn, using his blunt fingers to shape symbols representing the spirits who spoke to him. He did the rest of the forging with his magic, honing and shaping the old metal into something ornate and elaborate even as he worked it with his bare hands. \r\n\r\nIn time, word of his presence at the oasis spread, through the few Nomad tribes who dared trade with him for food and healing. Others sought him out, including sages from Velyzar and Ireth, seeking the Ogryn hermit who dwelt in the dead oasis. Some came to seek his wisdom; others, to slay him. He spoke freely to the former, and killed the latter. On occasion, he attempted to learn why someone might seek his death, but the answers were rarely satisfactory; mostly it was confusing talk of portents and prophecies.\r\n\r\nThe spirits showed Belletar that the thread of his fate lay tangled with the skein of another, when he brought his learnings to them. They whispered a name… Gharol Bloodmaul… and showed him a horde of dark shadows loping in pursuit of the warrior in question. He heard the rattle of chains, and the laughter of dead men, and knew that her pursuers were far more dangerous than a patrol of slave-takers. He could not allow the warrior to perish. His enemies were her enemies, and they were fated to fight them together. \r\n\r\nBelletar set off at once, following the whispers of the spirits. Many days of travel later, the wind brought the sounds of a conflict to him; he followed the noise and found himself on a ridge overlooking a bloody battlefield, where the necromancers and their Undead minions of the vision were locked in a struggle with a small band of Orcs. Leading the latter was a gigantic, reptilian-tailed figure wielding an enormous hammer that appeared to be cased in molten rock. \r\n\r\nBelletar knew instantly that the towering warrior was Gharol, the one he’d come to find. He joined the battle, calling upon the spirits to bolster his new allies as he did so. The Orcs were momentarily taken aback by the thundering new arrival, but soon saw that he was on their side, when he reinvigorated their tired muscles and healed their injuries. Belletar’s timely arrival helped the Orcs to scatter the enemy. As Gharol Bloodmaul pushed through the cheering Orcs to greet him, Belletar wondered what the future held in store for them.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8420#static": "As the Elven civil war tore his people and his family apart, Neldor’s grandfather passed to him a great secret of magical smithing, fearing that otherwise it might be lost in the chaos. The aged Elf described incantations of ice and frost that have to be chanted over ore kept continuously chilled. Even the shaping of the metal has to be done with arcane power instead of a furnace’s heat. The resulting metal exudes a constant aura of cold, enough to cause pain even before touching its surface – a devastating tool of war, provided the wielder takes precautions against the biting chill.\r\n\r\nUnder their grandfather’s watchful gaze, Neldor mastered the technique alongside his cousin Dirandil, and the two of them forged cold-imbued weapons for themselves. Dirandil created a pair of blades whose contours were graceful but savage, the hilts wrapped in insulating Elven-made silks. Neldor spent his precious allotment of enchanted metal to craft a sleek, bejeweled bastard sword, the hilt bound with gilt wood to protect the wielder's hands. Their ancient patriarch died, satisfied, just after witnessing this success, and after duly mourning their loss, the cousins were left to decide for themselves what to do with their inherited knowledge.\r\n\r\nNeldor’s heart ached from the misery of war. A new type of weapon would create new suffering and death, but it might nonetheless break the bloody stalemate on the border between High and Dark Elves and save lives by bringing the war’s end more quickly. Neldor was firmly an Aravian loyalist and held the Dreamwalker’s followers to be like rebellious children testing the limits of a permissive parent. Dirandil felt very differently. His sympathies lay more with the shadow magicians of the Dreamwalker’s circle. But he, unlike Neldor, did not care to truly commit to his cause. He was out for himself, desiring fame and glory and a test of his skill, wishing to use his unique blades for more exotic tasks than what he saw as menial warfare. \r\n\r\nNeldor was grieved to hear of Dirandil’s disillusionment with Aravia, but he was too proud to try to sway Dirandil back to loyalty. Instead he suggested Dirandil hunt monsters to win fame if that's what mattered to him, and their discussion became rancorous. Dirandil accused 'smirking golden child' Neldor of benefiting from their grandfather’s favoritism, and withholding some greater secret the old Elf had imparted to Neldor privately. As they made what would prove their final parting, Dirandil swore that he needed no patronizing suggestions or advice from cousin Neldor.\r\n\r\nHis failure to reconcile with even his own apathetic kinsman, let alone a true Dark Elf, shook Neldor’s confidence gravely. Years passed as he struggled to decide whether to share his knowledge for the good of the war effort, to teach only a select few apprentices, or even actively try to prevent its spread. The cleaving of Durham from Aravia became total and complete, and it did not surprise Neldor to know Dirandil was among the Dark Elves. But soon Neldor heard of a terrible Dark Elf assassin, whose weapons and whose gang of disciples were known as the Brumal Razors, and instantly realized that this was Dirandil’s idea of a worthy use for their grandfather’s legacy. His indecision swept away, Neldor provisioned himself and ventured into Durham against all advice, determined to reckon with Dirandil’s evil. It grieved him, but gave a grim satisfaction: his own brumal blade could finally find its purpose.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8430#static": "The Dragonkin Empire was the most powerful realm Teleria had ever known, and its people's science and inventions were great, as was their grasp of the arcane. Yet all of their knowledge could not save them when the legions of Siroth descended upon them.\r\n\r\nA number of Dragonkin mages took desperate action to preserve their work, hoping that once the armies of Darkness were driven back, they might resume their research. They walled up a number of arcane experiments and artifacts beneath an island far from the twin capitals of Allreach and Twinrift, in the hope that the tide of war would wash over without disturbing them.\r\n\r\nTo guard their treasures, the mages chose a warrior-warlock who had been bred solely for combat, a winged hero named Ostrox. The mages could not predict how long the war with Siroth might last, so they placed him into an enchanted slumber that would only end if the complex was disturbed by non-Dragonkin. They wrapped his scaled hide with magical bindings, vermin-proof cloth woven with spells of longevity and soaked in potions brewed to thwart decay and rot. The mages hoped they would preserve him and enable him to sleep for decades or longer, yet still awaken full of vigor.\r\n\r\nIn the war, the Dragonkin were annihilated, and the secrets of the mages died with them. Ostrox however, remained entombed with their artifacts. He slumbered away the centuries, unaware that even his island, so far from Allreach, had been been buried under layers of ash from the volcanic eruption that had destroyed the Dragonkin royal capital.\r\n\r\nAges passed but eventually the isolation of the buried chambers ended. Storms shifted the soil and ash above, and a band of adventurers discovered what had once been hidden.\r\n\r\nTheir presence awakened Ostrox. The resurrected Dragonkin cut down the hapless intruders, fresh blood spattering his dusty, ancient body. Yet as the instinctive need to kill the interlopers receded and Ostrox took stock, he came to a terrible realization.\r\n\r\nThe sorceries of the mages had not been enough to fully preserve his body. While Ostrox’s mind had endured, much of his flesh had decayed. His wings had withered and his scales had become dry and dead. Much time must have passed. Yet despite it all, he still felt strong and sharp.\r\n\r\nOstrox stalked through the chambers he had guarded, investigating the artifacts within, but found them rendered useless by the passage of time, collapses, and cave-ins. He could also sense that the magics binding him had changed, that it was not only the slow decay of the passing of ages that had eaten away at and changed his body.\r\n\r\nWith the artifacts he had once guarded now destroyed, Ostrox chose to leave the buried chambers, and discovered a world much changed. He traveled to Ireth aboard the boat of the adventurers he had killed, hoping that he would find out what had become of his people in the learned city. The Dragonkin were long gone, and Ireth was overrun with necromancy and the Undead. From the half-mad sorcerers and unquiet spirits there, Ostrox learned of how Siroth had unleashed a terrible spell across Teleria, known as the Scourge of Darkness. One of its effects had been to disturb the dead and breathe life into unliving bodies. The black sorceries had seeped into the soil, and Ostrox realized that was what had found purchase in him. He was now an Undead revenant, his body held together not only by the rites of Dragonkin mages, but by Siroth’s corrupt magics.\r\n\r\nOstrox resolved to discover more, about both Teleria, and about the sorceries that had left his body withered, yet as strong as ever. With time, he hoped to purge himself of Siroth’s corruption while still retaining his deathless state, thus unlocking the key to true immortality.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8460#static": "Hierophant Lazarius, Keeper of the Great Dragon Shrine of the city of Twinrift, was among the greatest luminaries of the Dragonkin Empire. But, driven by his liege lord the Emperor Undrakar, he became one of the architects of its downfall. His home of Twinrift, second center of power after the imperial capital of Allreach, was named for the Rift Below – a massive oceanic trench just offshore – and the Rift Above, a gleaming pinpoint of light hovering above the summit of the hill that overlooked Twinrift’s bay and anchorage. It was a tiny hole in reality, beaming out the raw potentiality of existence itself, the shining medium through which Lumaya and Siroth Danced all Teleria into being. \r\n\r\nIn awe of the Rift Above, the Dragonkin built the Great Dragon Shrine beneath it, and in their endless curiosity and ambition, they built a device called the Vortex to study and control it. Its use was as much an art as a science, and Lazarius’ skill allowed him – to an extent – to channel, reflect, and shape the emanations of the Rift, approaching, if only stumblingly, a power known only to the gods. He was quietly furious when the Emperor dragged him away from his work to pursue a different goal. \r\n\r\nEmperor Undrakar wanted to duplicate the dimensional breach of the Rift Above, at a grander scale, to make a gateway through which to send conquering legions. Claiming that, for state secrecy, even Lazarius could not know the full details of his plans, the Emperor begged Lazarius’ trust and asked for his expertise. Lazarius was doubtful, but he was a devoted Imperial citizen and servant, and so he quashed his misgivings and designed a huge structure of metal, stone, and crystal to serve as the mystic scaffolding of a huge spatial warp. In the valley of Stormwind it stood tall, broad, and elegant. When he was satisfied with the construction, Lazarius returned to Twinrift, leaving the Emperor’s favored son Ramantu to attune the portal’s destination in compliance with his father’s secret wishes. \r\n\r\nAs Lazarius proudly watched the inauguration of the portal in a burnished bronze scrying mirror, his satisfaction turned to terror when fiery gouts billowed from the opened doorway, and through it he saw a parched and blasted hellscape. Lazarius realized that all along Undrakar’s secret plan had been to breach into Anathraad. It was blasphemous folly – a stain on Teleria’s history that became known to future generations as the Sin of Dragons. \r\n\r\nThe Dragonkin army that marched through the portal was crushed. Siroth’s minions seized control of the portal, and launched an invasion of Teleria. The horror that unfolded was beyond reckoning, all the more so for guilt-wracked Lazarius. He worked feverishly with the Vortex, hoping the Rift Above might provide salvation. Within days, Allreach fell and the Imperial Fleet was obliterated, and Undrakar was forced to flee to Twinrift and the Great Dragon Shrine. Lazarius held his colossal rage and resentment in check, and counseled the disgraced Emperor.\r\n\r\nAs Demonspawn swarmed the streets of Twinrift, Lazarius wearily told the Emperor that his search had yielded only one remote, perilous possibility. Using the Vortex, along with the will and imagination of the mortal mind, they could fashion a war-beast from the stuff of eternity to defeat the Demonspawn and destroy the portal – now called the Brimstone Gate. But no mortal mind is constructed to wield the god-like power of creation, and it would exact a great toll. Only a mighty and steadfast ego could emerge unscathed, he warned.\r\n\r\nLazarius had not understood Undrakar’s true designs, but he knew his liege’s temperament. Undrakar would take any chance offered to him, his pride and paranoia permitting no other to be the conjurer of the Dragonkin’s revenge. And so Lazarius enticed his sinful Emperor to a grisly end: Undrakar was consumed with rage and madness as the Rift’s power surged through him, and from it sprang a many-headed Hydra so vast and terrible as to shake the world. Undrakar perished a broken husk, but not before witnessing what he had made, and gasping out a last cryptic command to Lazarius – or perhaps the Hydra – to end it all.\r\n\r\nLazarius beheld the Hydra, and the Demonspawn swarming the last bastion of his people’s greatness, with himself caught between. He realized there was one thing – one act of penance he could pay on behalf of his whole species – that could at one stroke stop both these threats from rampaging throughout the wider world. He collapsed the Rift Above, triggering a massive blast that obliterated Twinrift. Like the maw of a beast greater even than the Hydra, the sea and the Rift Below consumed all traces of Undrakar, the Hydra, and the last remaining bastion of Dragonkin power.\r\n\r\nBut not Lazarius. His initiating surge of magical energy, and his proximity to the epicenter, resulted in a different fate. The shining force of creation momentarily inverted itself as the Rift imploded, and Lazarius was de-created: every ontological particle of his being, across all mental, physical, and spiritual axes, was voided of validity, its animating light withdrawn, his self unbuilt. He became a noumenon, the ghost of an idea, a ripple or pattern in the glow of uncreation existing only as memory and conception. Yet somehow, in the faintest possible way, he still did exist.\r\n\r\nYears and centuries passed as Lazarius’ deeds reverberated through history. And then, as casually as a morning’s rising from easy slumber, Lazarius became extant again, his reality collapsing into being from the realms of the unreal. And where else did he find himself, but in the presence of the Arbiter – for who but she could call back the echo of the great sage, and remember his genius? If the Sin of Dragons is unpardonable, who but the Arbiter could give Lazarius anything close to redemption for his errantry?",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8470#static": "The creature known as Aphidus the Hivelord has only recently appeared to the Dark Elves, and regards Durham Forest and all within as his property or prey, to do with as he sees fit. While, at times, he has the appearance of an Elf, at other times he takes the form of a monstrous insect, a thing of iron-hard chitin and bone-crushing claws. The latter is his natural form, for he is one of the great beasts that have dwelled and ruled in Durham for far longer than any Elf.\r\n\r\nAphidus’ existence first came to light after a brutal series of attacks on several Dark Elf logging expeditions to the Bleakwood, in the northern spiderglens. Until then, the Bleakwood was thought to be relatively placid, thus the attacks came as a shock to the forestry guilds of the northern canopy-settlements. Rangers were dispatched from the town of Redmoss to investigate. \r\n\r\nNone returned… at least not in one piece.\r\n\r\nThe eviscerated bodies of the dead Rangers were deposited on the outskirts of the logging camp of Welt by parties unknown. Each of the unlucky Elves appeared to have been carefully vivisected, as if someone or something were studying them. Necromancy was suspected; the logging teams refused to go out, especially after one reported seeing the enigmatic creature known as Ruel the Huntmaster. Mercenaries were dispatched to force the loggers back to work. \r\n\r\nWork resumed, though at a slower rate. Attacks against the logging teams became commonplace, with predatory insects being the culprits in every instance. At the same time, the Cult of the Fang gravitated toward the logging camp, bringing more disruption. \r\n\r\nA few months later, a messenger arrived… one of several loggers who’d gone missing and been presumed dead. \r\n\r\nThe logger was terrified to the point of madness, but otherwise in good health. He spoke of swarms of bone-beetles, blood-wasps, and the great white centipedes that hunted in the upper canopy like wolves all being on the move. Welt, he insisted, was surrounded by a veritable army, and that it and all the settlements of the Bleakwood would soon be destroyed, unless they negotiated. A 'great leader' was waiting at the heart of Bleakwood to speak with the ruling Dark Elves in the area. \r\n\r\nThough the very idea of this was offensive to the Dark Elf leadership, as word of the incident spread throughout the northernmost settlements, the merchant-lords of Redmoss realized that the only way to maintain their authority and ensure the sanctity of their revenue streams was to meet with this so-called ‘great leader’. An expedition was mounted, consisting of several prominent nobles, including Ansell Grimir, the Baron of Redmoss, their personal household guards, as well as a hundred Crimson Helms, led by Captain Darga Preyk. \r\n\r\nWhen the expedition reached Welt, they were joined by a large group of Fang Clerics, who insisted that it was their responsibility to translate for the insects. Baron Ansell, no fool and well aware of the cult’s reputation, agreed. \r\n\r\nThe enigmatic Ruel was awaiting the group on the outskirts of the camp. It was clear to Ansell that the Huntmaster was to be their escort, and they entered the Bleakwood with the eerie wanderer at the head of their party. \r\n\r\nMany conflicting stories have emerged about the travails of the Dark Elves’ journey; the most common describe how the travelers were shadowed by packs of leafscuttlers and root-slitherers, as well as how Ruel seemed to be in communication with these beasts. \r\n\r\nThe meeting place was an ancient dolmen, its black stones wreathed in thick roots and nests of poison ivy. Waiting for them there was something that resembled an Elf. His skin, where it was not hidden beneath gruesome, organic-looking armor, was the color of insect-bile. His hair was like cobwebs, he greeted them in voice the sound of a hundred droning flies, and his movements were like the scuttling of a scorpion. He bore a huge, stinger-shaped blade that, like his armor, seemed to have been grown rather than forged. \r\n\r\nThe strange being called himself Aphidus and declared himself Hivelord of Bleakwood. He commanded that the Dark Elves leave its confines, and cease their efforts to harvest its lumber. In return, he would personally direct them to more profitable regions for harvesting, and see that they were spared the attention of the insects which lurked there. Ansell and the other nobles huddled together to discuss this. As they did so, more and larger insects arrived. Ansell realized that the expedition was hugely outnumbered. He also noted the odd smile on Aphidus’ waxen face… as the being was not sure how to hold the expression. \r\n\r\nThe nobles agreed to Aphidus’ proposal, all too aware that the creature had them at his mercy. Even so, they could not help but wonder why such a powerful being would negotiate. Ansell, braver than the rest, dared to ask that very question. Instead of answering, however, the Hivelord gave a gurgling laugh and turned to depart. As he did so, he shed his Elven form, revealing a hulking, insectoid shape, like some abominable hybrid of scorpion, centipede, and beetle. Moments later, he was gone, melted into the forest, Ruel with him, as well as the host of beasts that surrounded the Dark Elves. \r\n\r\nIn the months since, Aphidus has been as good as his word. He has even taken the field himself more than once alongside Dark Elf forces, gorily eviscerating enemies with claw and blade, or leaving them paralyzed or writhing in pain as if on fire with his venoms. While Redmoss and the other northern settlements act in public as if the arrangement is a beneficial one, some whisper that a creature like Aphidus would not make such a bargain without an ulterior motive. Even the Cult of the Fang has no answers, but some among them mutter of a ‘great discontent’ among the monstrous inhabitants of the deep forest, and they cannot help but wonder if this ‘alliance’ with the Hivelord is but a harbinger of more dangerous times to come…",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8480#static": "Among the colonies of the Dragonkin Empire of old was an archipelago in the east of the great island chain of Torcelin Istriv, later known as the Lost Isles. Called Maru Toba, this island cluster was ruled by an Ogryn warlord and former Dragonkin auxiliary named Ugir, but was subject to the directives of the Dragon Emperor. Ugir’s tribe provided manpower for the Empire in exchange for their semi-independence.\r\n\r\nDragonkin rule had always sat ill with Ugir and his people, but the relationship soured further as the Emperor made ever-greater demands. Imperial forces were mobilizing for an expedition through the newly constructed Brimstone Gate, and more of Ugir’s people were being conscripted. All complaints were ignored, and the Dragonkin began to employ force. That was their first mistake.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about Ogryn being kidnapped and enslaved, Ugir took action. He killed and skinned one Dragonkin overseer and wrenched the horns from another. He ordered him to return to his Emperor and tell him Maru Toba would serve no longer.\r\n\r\nThe response was predictable. A Dragonkin fleet arrived, transporting an imperial army to quash Maru Toba’s rebellion.\r\n\r\nUgir’s people were outnumbered, but the odds did not concern the Ogryn. His time in the imperial legions had taught him the Dragonkin’s tactics well.\r\n\r\nThe Dragonkin thought of Ogryn as brutal and simplistic, and expected to engage in a pitched battle where their superior tactics and numbers would see them victorious. Their landing was uncontested, something they assumed would merely be the first of a host of tactical blunders made by their unsophisticated foes. But as they advanced into the jungles covering the interior, they found themselves ambushed by Ogryn again and again, who cut off and massacred advance parties, using the attacks to lure in reserves who they in turn encircled and crushed. Dragonkin casualties mounted. \r\n\r\nUgir’s Ogryn also employed terror tactics, leaving severed heads and skinned, reptilian hides along the paths being used by the invaders. Ugir himself accentuated his armor with skins and the bony horns and crests of the Dragonkin he killed, and crafting a jagged bone ax from their remains. His greatest victory came when slew the expedition’s commander during a daring raid. Later in that same battle, Ugir was beset by the great, reptilian demi-wyrm the commander often rode into battle, but the Ogryn met the beast head on, wrestling it down and cutting its gullet with a vicious slash of his ax. He later devoured its carcass. In doing so he claimed to have consumed the very spirit of the monster, and earned himself the name ‘Wyrmeater’.\r\n\r\nWhile the Ogryn’s resistance was great, their defiance could not endure forever. A new Dragonkin commander was appointed. He adopted a more meticulous strategy, using his superior numbers to strangle resistance. His fleet cut off one island at a time. Dragonkin took to felling the jungle, restricting the areas in which the Ogryn could employ their devastating tactics. Ugir and his warriors were eventually isolated on the last free island of Maru Toba, where they prepared for one more stand. But a valiant death at the hands of the Dragonkin Empire was not the Wyrmeater’s destiny.\r\n\r\nWider events intervened in the war for Maru Toba. Siroth’s forces in Anathraad had defeated the Dragonkin incursion and were now spilling into Teleria, assaulting every part of the Empire.\r\n\r\nUgir was horrified by the twisted Demonic newcomers with their warped Dragonkin forms, and the terrible slaughter they inflicted, but held a quiet hope he could take advantage of their invasion. It granted him and his warriors a welcome reprieve. He also agreed to a cautious, temporary alliance with the leader of the Anathraad forces sent to Maru Toba, Kravakz. The Dragonkin, already thrown into disarray by desperate orders from the Emperor to return to defend the fleet-city of Twinrift, were easy prey to the combined might of Demonspawn and Ogryn.\r\n\r\nFor Ugir, the victory was short-lived. Kravakz claimed Maru Toba in the name of the Shadow God. Ugir had been preparing for such an eventuality however, hoarding captured Dragonkin ships, and striking up a pact with Dragonkin prisoners, agreeing to free and arm them if they would wreak vengeance on the Demonspawn. The efforts of the Empire to drive out the Ogryn had been moderate compared to what the Demonspawn unleashed when Ugir refused to submit. Monstrosities rampaged through the remaining jungle, and Kravakz conjured Demonic fires to sear away both forest and Ogryn alike. Still, Ugir fought on. It was no longer a battle for freedom but a fight for survival. He led from the front, and his experience in hit-and-run tactics was bolstered by the bitter resistance offered by the surviving Dragonkin.\r\n\r\nUltimately the wider Demonic invasion of Teleria failed. Kravakz and his legion were forced to withdraw. They left behind ravaged islands, but inhabitants who were free. Though few Ogryn had survived, their legacy would endure, thanks to the ceaseless leadership, strength, and brute determination of Ugir the Wyrmeater.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8490#static": "Across the Deadlands and the Krokhan Desert, tales are told of a once-bloodthirsty mercenary. Her name was Xena, and she killed her way across the Barren Steppes, the Scorchlands, and her home of Hell’s Basin, becoming one of the strongest and most ruthless warriors the continent of Peltas had ever seen, leaving a trail of destruction in her wake.\r\n\r\nThat was until she was visited in a dream by a mysterious stranger. The hooded figure told Xena to seek forgiveness for the pain she had caused and live a life in which she defended the weak and stood against injustice. The figure said there was goodness in Xena’s heart; she had simply to find  her way. Xena could not deny that the figure had moved her. She remembered the words of an old friend – killing isn’t the only way of proving yourself a warrior. She had scoffed at the time, but now felt sure she was wrong to. As Xena opened her mouth to question the figure, she awoke and although the figure was gone, the feeling remained.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, Xena journeyed to the Nomad clans, protecting them from Demonspawn, Orc bandits, Irethi soul-thieves, and Velyzari slavers. Much to her own surprise, she made friends and became a beacon of hope. A young woman joined her. The legend of Xena, the warrior princess, spread throughout the continent, as clans far and wide heard of the fierce warrior who defended those who could not defend themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the mysterious stranger returned to Xena in another dream, they told Xena to return home, to help her own people. She departed upon awakening and was no more than ten leagues away when she heard local tribespeople speaking of a clan that had been mercilessly killing and looting their way all over Hell’s Basin, led by a ferocious warlord. Fear gripped her heart. As she traveled closer, Xena heard of more atrocities. Resolve slowly replaced her fear. She would not allow her people to suffer any more.\r\n\r\nWhen Xena reached Hell’s Basin, she saw thick, black smoke pouring into the air from behind a hill. From the top, she looked into a valley where a village was aflame. Brutish figures were dragging people from their homes and lining them up for execution. A mass of bodies was already piled high, and raiders were looting them. Xena watched in horror as a group of children tried to make their escape before being seized and brought before the executioner. Unable to contain her fury, Xena roared and charged into the village, her shouts gaining the raiders’ attention. She cut down the executioner within seconds, and urged the children and other survivors to flee even as warriors raced to attack her. It was then that a shrill and bone-chilling cry echoed through the air. The raiders halted and lowered their weapons, parting to make way for a woman, evidently their warlord. Xena recognized her face. It was one that forever burned in her mind, one of a child who watched helplessly as Xena had cut her parents down in a bloody fury. Xena’s heart felt heavy with guilt, but she readied her blade nonetheless. The clan’s evil could not continue.\r\n\r\nThe warlord roared that Xena’s head was hers alone. Xena did not want to kill the warlord – enough blood had been spilled already. She apologized desperately, trying to convince the warlord that she had changed her ways and that killing her would not change the past. Her cries fell on deaf ears and the warlord charged. They fought for hours, Xena constantly on the defensive. She dodged hammer blows that would have crushed her skull and blade thrusts that could have disemboweled her. She realized it was kill or be killed. As a last ditchattempt to end the fight there and then, Xena pulled away from the warlord and threw her chakram at her. It sliced through the warlord’s armor and pierced her chest. She collapsed, coughing up blood and wheezing. As she breathed her last, Xena dropped to her knees and lowered her head. It seemed as though there was no way of escaping the repercussions of her past, no matter what she did.\r\n\r\nHaving saved the village, Xena returned to her own clan, deflated. Evil had grown as a direct result of her actions. That night, the mysterious stranger appeared in a dream once more. Xena did not protest or question; she merely sat. The stranger calmed Xena’s heart with their mere presence. This calm was neither absolution nor forgiveness; but it was something – a sense of responsibility; a call to continue righting the wrongs of her former life by protecting the innocent and defending the weak. A call that Xena decided she would answer for the rest of her life.",

He was tending cattle in the fields south of Tilshire, when a squall forced him to excavate a sod dugout to weather the storm and spend the night in. Nigh-entombed in soil and moss, he slipped into his last Human slumber. \r\n\r\nBy malign chance, he had laid down atop an buried portal to Anathraad, its magic frayed, leaking, and unstable. Like the thunderhead above, the portal had been building up a charge, and the cowherd’s soul drew a lightning-strike of planar energy that whipped out and snatched him from his hovel. With a thunderclap from both the sky and ground, the hapless herdsman vanished from history.\r\n\r\nHe reappeared in a hellish mire of scalding mud. Streaks of flame darted across sickly purple skies, and huge bubbles of muddy ooze swelled and burst with a sound like a shriek of agony. Before him was a minor Demon, a mischievous imp calling herself Hyx. Her idle wish for sadistic new entertainment, made by chance in proximity to the portal’s long-forgotten exit, triggered it to briefly open and shut. The mind of her new toy had shattered upon witnessing Anathraad, spoiling her fun. Rather than leaving the comatose flesh to the Pit Curs, Hyx infused it with a corrupted animal spirit, creating an infernal Skinwalker she called Bovos.\r\n\r\nHyx wagered that the tear between worlds could sustain one last transfer, if properly provoked. Though now corrupted, Bovos was of mortal clay, and so could pass back to Teleria. Hyx bid Bovos form the nucleus of a cult to worship her and, in time, repair and expand the gateway to make a second Brimstone Gate. With him she sent a tiny effigy of seemingly innocuous wood and twine, which in fact was the symbol of their covenant and imbued with enough of Hyx’s magic to grant Bovos mystic powers.\r\n\r\nBack on Teleria at the site of his disappearance, Bovos sought civilization, remembering nothing of his old life. He came across a half-rotted old barn and made it his lair, and located the nearby hamlet which had abandoned it. There, guided by the whispers of his talisman, he stalked its most vulnerable and weak-minded members and transmitted those whispers to them: the liar who slept drunkenly by the bonfire, the children abed with malcontent in their hearts, the adulterous spouse, the faithless and ambitious priest. Half the hamlet was ripe for Demonic influence. The cult began to meet by night every few weeks on dates of mystical numerological potency. Human disciples acted as intermediaries, only slowly revealing the ‘divine mystery’ of the bull-headed Skinwalker and the strange ‘miracles’ he could perform to others – many of the simple villagers had not yet seen nor heard of Skinwalkers, and their ability to distinguish subtle Demon-hexes from wholesome Lumayan rituals was poor. The most privileged of his followers could lay their eyes on the Bovosian Tablet, a great stone upon which Sharphorn's wisdom was carved, and upon which he later performed ritual sacrifice to his Demonic liege.\r\n\r\nBut then the first stirrings of the Red Crusade swept through Anhelt. As paranoia grew, Bovos took drastic measures to keep himself secret, but it was not enough. Word of a man-beast was leaked to inquisitors and a gang of armed crusaders arrived in the hamlet. Bovos and his greatest loyalists barricaded themselves in the barn, but the crusaders whipped the town into a frenzy, and the creaking timber was no match for dozens of sledges and mattocks. \r\n\r\nBovos and his fanatics stood defiant. A bloodbath ensued. The notorious tale spread like wildfire, and Bovos came to symbolize all Skinwalkers in the eyes of the Sacred Order: children of Siroth at heart and a manifestation of pure corruption.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8520#static": "Chaos; pandemonium; bedlam; disorder. These are all that Karnage the Anarch, a master manipulator and sadistic killer, has ever cared for. \r\n\r\nThe horrifying and unexpected can cause desperation in any soul, and in reaction to these events individuals are forced to behave in ways they normally never would to survive. Thus they bring about novelty, and to witness this is Karnage's driving force. Why he is like this is a mystery beyond even the gods – not even they truly understand what happened when the Firstborn were created. Each being birthed from that experiment was unique in temperament and desires. There were angelic beings of sublime beauty and purity of spirit, creatures that defied any categorization, and beasts of undeniably malignant heart and monstrous bearing.\r\n\r\nAfter the Dance of Darkness forever drove a wedge of hatred between Lumaya and Siroth and the Great Divorce began, no one who knew Karnage was surprised that he took the Shadow God's side. For years he had been a sower of discord between mortals and immortals alike, a malicious experimenter whose caprice resulted in the spilling of blood and the toppling of keeps. His allegiance to Siroth was not something born of any kind of loyalty, Karnage merely saw that the god's plans were by far the most entertaining. The Dance of Darkness had bred all manner of slobbering predatory beasts and malformed creatures that wreaked havoc wherever they tread or slithered. The prospect of the Shadow God creating more and more without check was one Karnage relished. Lumaya's relentless penchant for order and regularity was something so painfully dull to him that the thought of it playing any dominant role in the world was the only thing he truly feared.\r\n\r\nSiroth suffered setback after setback in the centuries that followed. The banishment spell saw the immortals cast from Teleria itself, a disaster only turned around when the later Dragonkin invasion of Anathraad failed and the Demons could use the mortal bodies of captured soldiers to return to Teleria. Karnage took great pleasure in choosing the most honorable captive he could find to possess to make himself a Demonspawn. The First Great War, which followed the Demonspawn's invasion of the mortal world, ended in catastrophic defeat. Karnage was furious for a time, for failure stalled plans of his that would cause untold mayhem and conflict. But the debacle proved to be even more enjoyable to him. Siroth's rage and the frustrations of his fellow Demonspawn were amusing to a degree he hadn't anticipated.\r\n\r\nUltimately, what were setbacks for Siroth were, at most, partly so for Karnage. The capture of the Brimstone Gate and the Shadow God's creation of innumerable portals gave easy access to Teleria from Anathraad, and ever since Karnage taken great advantage of this.\r\n\r\nTo the Dwarves, during the collapse of their great under-empire, Karnage was known as the Grinning Flame, who laughed while trapping detachments of warriors in caved-in tunnels with slavering Demonspawn hounds, and using torrents of balefire to force skittering Demonspawn toward ranks of Dwarven crossbowmen. When Siroth's forces surged across the Winterlands to seize the Waters of Life, Karnage took the form of Norr refugees. He went from village to village telling the inhabitants that their neighbors sought to betray them, weakening Telerian unity in the face of Demonspawn hordes. Karnage laughed as the Ice Golem tore through the great and good of the Confederation of Frostheim. He delighted as Elf fought Elf in their tumultuous and bloody civil war. Lady Mikage herself called him the Burner of Webs, for his feeding of false intelligence to her network of operatives and turning many for and against her. In the buildup to the Red Crusade, Karnage whispered into the ears of Skinwalkers and Orcs, as well as Sacred Order warriors and lords of Kaerok, stirring up mutual hatred and encouraging unprovoked attacks on all. Karnage cares not for who wins or loses wars in Teleria, nor in the endless politicking of Anathraad. He lives only for the chaos they cause. The conflicts are but a game, the entire world a board upon which he moves all the pieces he wishes according to ever-changing rules, entirely his own.\r\n\r\nMany Demonspawn, as well as Telerians who know of Karnage's existence, believe that he has interfered with Siroth's own designs, too. Hypotheses have spread that he encouraged Demonspawn in Teleria to take no part in the Third Great War, and to turn on Lady Mikage in Yakai. It may have even been Karnage's idea that Siroth attempt to force Lumaya to dance with him, millennia ago. Karnage neither confirms nor denies any of these allegations. As for Siroth himself, as much as the Anarch might be a dangerous force, his desire for greater chaos is one predictable thing about him, and Siroth is, if nothing else, a seeker of novelty himself. All in all, for every injury Karnage may have inflicted upon the God of Shadow, he has inflicted ten upon his foes.\r\n\r\nKarnage's latest experiment is with the Free City of Sintranos, to ‘see how wounded dogs might bite, if someone rattled their cage'. Devastated during the Gaellen War and never recovered, it was eclipsed by its sister city of Delanos in the conflict's aftermath. It was a place of malaise and quiet despair, full of the hopeless and the lethargic, making it ripe for the Anarch's attention. As he saw it, its people needed something to stir them to life from their moribund, impoverished existence. The medium he chose was a mediocre mage of middling age called Amius, who was torn between the safety of the city he knew and the sense that out in the wider world something better waited for him. The man was weak, and open to the honeyed words and promises of power Karnage fed to him in disguise. What happened next caused Sintranos to be cursed beyond recognition, and brought about a veritable maelstrom of confused panic, turmoil, and death that threatens to draw in forces unnumbered.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8530#static": "Legend has it that a single tree stands atop the crown of the world, in the Winterlands. The stories claim that it is an immense fir, taller than almost any tower. How it came to be there, in the frozen tundra, far from the evergreen forests of the southern regions is unknown. Many believe that it was planted by Sir Nicholas himself, though why he might have done so is a mystery. What is known is that the tree has a defender… a single lonely sentinel, who stands watch over the Winterlands. Such is the tale of Firrol the Barkhorn. \r\n\r\nHow Firrol came to be in the Winterlands is as much a mystery as the origin of the great tree that he is connected with. The most common claim is that he was born there, grown from a fir sapling taken from the Mistwood by Sir Nicholas, so that he might aid in the Lightbringer's duties. Some state that Firrol came to those forbidding lands from the Mistwood of his own volition, following the unique Rhythm of the great tree planted by Sir Nicholas. Regardless of the reasons, he has taken it upon himself to become a guardian not just of the tree, but of the Winterlands themselves. \r\n\r\nThe tree that Firrol is said to guard is supposedly lit by a thousand candles, which never gutter out, no matter how the wind howls. Its roots are said to reach all the way to the Waters of Life, though whether this is true or not only Sir Nicholas, or perhaps the Arbiter, knows. Some believe that Sir Nicholas planted it so that it might act as a light in a place of such total darkness. Others insist that the Lightbringer planted the tree on the advice of the Sylvan Watchers of the Mistwood, that it, in some way, acts to strengthen the Rhythm which guides them. \r\n\r\nPerhaps that is why Firrol came, though none can say for sure as he is not the most talkative of beings. Indeed, few have ever even seen him up close – often he is little more than a shadow glimpsed amid the furious snows. There are many tales of Firrol's wanderings across the Winterlands, and while in many he is a heroic figure, lending aid to explorers or rescuing lost travelers, in others he is a more terrifying force, a nightmarish spirit of winter and wood. He is the darkness at the fire's edge and the howl of the arctic wind. Whatever the story, when seen his appearance is the same: a towering figure covered in evergreen branches and thick bark, topped by an immense pair of antlers, with a great number of bells hanging from his arboreal form. The latter herald his coming, and their clangor can be heard for leagues in all directions. \r\n\r\nIt is unclear if he goes about his duties with the approval or instruction of Sir Nicholas, but on more than one occasion Firrol has been noted in the company of the legendary Reinbeasts, who are said to serve the ancient Lightbringer. In battle, Firrol is a juggernaut, striding across the field and smashing aside enemies with great sweeps of clawed hands – few foes can resist his immense strength. Besides that, as wind passes over his leaves, bark, and bells, it creates a terrifying and disorienting cacophony his enemies hear, but which he filters through the Rhythm for his allies to render it into a heart-stirring symphony that bolsters their resolve and courage.\r\n\r\nFirrol has many great battles to his credit; in the forgotten Norr settlement of Rimestone, his sudden arrival ensured the survival of a band of Human and Dwarven treasure-hunters beset by a pack of savage Frost-hounds and their Demonspawn master. Farther south, he slew the legendary Icebear, Kazrakag, when the malign creature had chosen a camp of Norr reindeer herders for its prey. But perhaps his greatest feat is his unending battle against the ancient Demonspawn known as Perkas Childeater. Perkas is said to haunt the southern Winterlands, preying on the children of the few remaining Norr inhabitants, or else trying to destroy the great tree that stands in the north. Whether the abomination does these things out of malice, or because he is commanded to do so by Siroth, none know. He is a fell thing; horned and hoofed, with claws of iron, wrapped in chains that forever steam with the heat of Anathraad. Some believe that he was unleashed by Siroth to bedevil Sir Nicholas, bringing woe and despair where the Lightbringer strives to bring hope. \r\n\r\nFirrol has battled Perkas many times over the centuries. He has defeated the Demonspawn more than once, but Perkas always returns. Their conflict has ranged from one end of the Winterlands to the other, with no clear end in sight. \r\n\r\nYet, so long as Firrol stands, so too shall the great tree. So say the tales.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8540#static": "Blizaar the Howler is a beast created out of loss and bitterness, so it is fitting that he is associated with the darkest days of winter's depths.\r\n\r\nThe Icecrushers are an Ogryn tribe living high in the Redspike Mountains. For centuries, they conducted a midwinter festival that involved the lighting of fires, the giving of gifts, and the cooking of a great feast. Yet one of their number, a young Ogryn named Grunch, never partook in the festive spirit, and after ruining the great feast one year, he was banished. He took to a life of crime and betrayal, as he hired out his services as a thief throughout the kingdom of Frostheim.\r\n\r\nOne of his employers was a Dark Elf sorceress named Lyrax. She herself had been banished from among her kind, forced to leave Durham Forest after the elemental magics she practiced brought on a punishing early winter. While traveling the Redspikes she encountered Grunch. Thinking he would be perfect as a dumb, brutish assistant, she took him on as her servant. But while Grunch served Lyrax well initially, in truth he was never the simple Ogryn Lyrax thought he was.\r\n\r\nGrunch merely acted the dumb ally until he had an opportunity to steal a number of Lyrax's valuable arcane scrolls. The Dark Elf flew in a wild fit of rage, furious at having been misled by what she considered to be an inferior being, and swore she would hunt down and punish Grunch. She realized she knew little of the Ogryn, for Grunch had concealed much of his past, but she had at least ascertained his tribe of origin – the Icecrushers.\r\n\r\nLyrax stepped out onto the mountainside close to her lair, disdaining the icy blizzard filling the air that night. Using all of her cryomantic abilities, she crafted a golem-like being of snow and ice, each delicate movement of her long, pale fingers singing the rime. She created a beast akin to an Ogryn, but bulkier, with a gaping maw filled with ice-fangs. She used the howling wind to give it breath, and gave it a heart made from the black stone of the mountain. Lastly, Lyrax created a jagged ice ax for the brute to wield. Thus was born the great snogryn, Blizaar the Howler.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Elf imbued Blizaar with the cruelty and love of violence so many Dark Elves possessed, before giving him a simple and singular purpose. He was to hunt down and destroy Grunch, and he was to start his search among the Icecrushers. Blizaar advanced into the storm, the shifting snow he lumbered through drawn by his arcane connection to the elements to add itself to his bulk and strength.\r\n\r\nLyrax had created a powerful being, but in her haste and anger she had failed to kindle enough intelligence in the snogryn's mind. The beast had only a dim understanding of its instructions, and quickly confused Grunch for the Icecrushers as a whole. He arrived among the tribe not long after Grunch himself had taken his revenge on them, stealing that season's feast and gifts before disappearing. The luckless Icecrushers were just coming to terms with the theft when Blizaar the Howler descended on them like an avalanche.\r\n\r\nThe snogryn tore through the tribe with pure elemental fury, wrecking homesteads, stores, and hacking down any who got in his path. The Icecrushers' attempts to halt the beast failed – whenever Blizaar's body was wounded, the surrounding snow and ice regenerated him.\r\n\r\nThe Icecrushers were devastated. Only when their village was in ruins did Blizaar depart, returning to Lyrax. When she saw him, he was draped in bells, antlers, wreaths, bones, and skulls, a combination of grisly trophies as well as decorations that had wrapped around him on his rampage. He even carried a door, resembling a shield. From the blood staining his snow-form and from the crackling, splitting sounds that sounded like sick laughter, the Dark Elf assumed he had been successful. Considering that vengeance had been taken, she sought to unbind the golem, first relinquishing control of him to ensure any harm he suffered was not transferred to her, then opening the clouds overhead, causing sunlight to spear down upon Blizaar in the belief that he would melt in it.\r\n\r\nBlizaar howled in pain, but to Lyrax's horror, the light was not enough to dissolve his form. Her will, while she had created Blizaar, had been too cold, too bitter, and it continued to animate the snogryn in defiance of the sun's heat.\r\n\r\nRealizing his creator was seeking to destroy him, Blizaar snatched Lyrax and plunged his razor-ice teeth into her neck and shoulder, the crushing bite ripping her apart. He then ate her flesh, which froze within his grave-cold form. Freed from Lyrax's bindings, the snogryn then set out across Frostheim. The devastation he wreaked on the Icecrushers brought him great joy and satisfaction. He sought to repeat the destruction on an ever-greater scale, descending on towns and settlements like the wrath of the harshest Frostheim winter made manifest.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8550#static": "Winter and death are intrinsically connected. Cold and hunger saps a soul of its strength, and so many Telerian cultures have various festivals, feasts, and holy days throughout the season that guarantee company and a warm fire, such as Yuletide. With these occasions go famous figures and the stories that surround them – the infamous Ogryn feast-thief, Grunch, the mighty Sir Nicholas, or the elemental snow monster known as Blizaar the Howler. Few of these near-mythical winter-beings elicit a response among the common people quite like Karilon the Ringer.\r\n\r\nIn stories, Karilon comes most commonly in winter’s final month. For many, this is the most difficult time, when storehouses and larders packed full at the start of the season have grown all but bare.\r\n\r\nWhere Karilon comes from, none of the story-tellers know. The first a village or town knows of his presence is the ringing of bells, a slow, sonorous clanging that accompanies his measured pace. The noise brings people to their doors and windows, wiping away frost and condensation, many wondering at first just who – or what – seems to be calling out to them.\r\n\r\nThe figure they see is as foreboding as the sound of his arrival. Karilon is a tall and gaunt man, clad in plates of black and gray armor, and draped with an old, crimson robe trimmed with white fur. On his head he wears a spiked helm with a faceplate that obscures his features, replacing them with a carved steel visage of a bearded man with a cold and stoic expression. On his back is a heavy shield, while in his right fist he grips a staff surmounted by a withered wreath and a trio of bells, the source of the ringing that heralds his coming.\r\n\r\nIn the fables, Karilon serves a purpose that is at once bleak yet hopeful. He rings out the last dregs of winter and ushers in the start of spring. In doing so, he collects the weak and dying and leads them toward a new afterlife of peace. For most this is a mere story, but for some, it has a far greater meaning, for Karilon the Ringer is a Knight Revenant, and the acolytes of the Cult of K’Leth hold him in highest reverence.\r\n\r\nCultists believe that Karilon comes to lead acolytes to their new bodies. When he appears in a town, those with enough courage and conviction follow him. Cold mist summoned by his tolling bells wreath the path they walk, hiding them from those not loyal to the teachings of K’Leth. The slow ringing of Karilon’s bells keeps their course true, and he leads them to the lair of a Soul Shepherd by routes only he knows. There, the worthy have their essence transferred into soul gems, ensuring they will continue to exist until their consciousness can be planted into a fresh body.\r\n\r\nThis much is true, though common cultists do not realize that the chances of receiving a new body for their soul are vanishingly slim. Karilon, once he has brought his latest band of acolytes into the presence of a Soul Shepherd, stands watch over the ceremonial magics of transference, acting as both a guard and a vigil. In the former role he is a fearsome individual, the arcane nature of his bells meaning that, should he will it, the sonic resonance of the chimes can freeze an opponent in place or rob them of their strength. Even more so than the Crypt Witches – the traditional guardians of the Soul Shepherds – having Karilon the Ringer present ensures a soul transference will be successfully completed.\r\n\r\nKarilon’s supposed role as a guide and guardian for the cult’s faithful ensures he is one of the Knights Revenant most revered by the misguided, common acolytes. Indeed, so great are the tales associated with him that some look to Karilon as the mightiest Knight Revenant of all, only just below the great K’Leth himself. These acolytes carry small bells on their person, tattoo them onto their skin, and strain eagerly during every winter’s dawn for the sound of Karilon’s coming, certain it is the only sure way of attaining the immortality they crave.\r\n\r\nKarilon cares nothing for the sub-cult dedicated to him. A former student of Umbral on the dreaded isle of Perdition, his loyalty is to K’Leth and no other. He knows that his purpose is to act as a beacon of false hope, and to lead the lost to an early damnation. The tolling of his bells are not merely for the cultists – they announce to the Knights Revenant the beginning of a new year, and a new harvest of fresh bodies for them to steal and inhabit.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8560#static": "Gwyndolin the Silent is an auxiliary: a permanent non-Elven resident of Aravia accorded a citizenship status close to that of trueborn High Elves, yet treated as a social inferior whose presence is contingent upon obedient service. Gwyndolin, however, was once herself a High Elf. After her Skinwalker transformation, she chose to remain in Aravia rather than leave in shame as many High Elven Skinwalkers do. Perhaps this was because Gwyndolin always had some solidarity with the auxiliaries, and cultivated a rapport with them as a child. \r\n\r\nIn adolescence Gwyndolin was sent to tour Felwin’s Wall as part of her general education. The trip changed her forever, though her memory is fragmented and official accounts cannot agree on what really happened to her there. She admits sneaking out to see the top of the Wall and speak to its guards by night. It is agreed she vanished shortly after arriving. Gwyndolin said that while she was peering into the gloom toward Durham Forest, a massive snowy owl swooped noiselessly out of the darkness, wings as broad as a house and eyes aglint with strange luminescence. It enveloped her in darkness and she saw only brief, delirious glimpses of distant lights, like cities at night glimpsed from afar. Then, after a time unknowable to her, she was released. She fell toward treetops, and she spread out her wings and glided to slow her fall – she did not realize she had wings, but she did, and they were helping her. But she still could only tumble and crash through the dense branches of the canopy, and was knocked unconscious.\r\n\r\nSearchers from the Wall found a battered Skinwalker whose form echoed that of a snowy owl, lying amid leaves and broken branches in a grove some five minutes’ walk from where Gwyndolin had disappeared. Under guard, she recuperated, and since the incident had taken place on the Wall, during a time of heightened tensions and high danger of subversive activity, the Aravian security apparatus swooped in to take charge of Gwyndolin and her exceptional case. A stern, masked envoy of the state came to give her a weighty ultimatum.\r\n\r\nAs far as the envoy’s investigators were concerned, Gwyndolin’s story was, at the very least, not actionable intelligence. Consensus held that what Gwyndolin remembered was a scrambled distortion of something else, a delusion or repression of the truth. It was the opinion of the monarch’s deputies that Gwyndolin had been abducted, but not by a supernatural beast. They blamed a conspiracy of subversive Elves who sought to breach the Wall, humiliate its guardians, and de-legitimize it in the eyes of the people. Various reports of ‘Winged Elves’ were attributed to the region of the Wall where the incident took place, and different theories of Fae, Skinwalker cults, and unorthodox magic were being debated. \r\n\r\nGwyndolin was now more a liability than a potential good citizen, so said the envoy – unless she submitted to close scrutiny and lifelong state control, in which she would perform spycraft and counterintelligence against whoever or whatever is behind the Winged Elves and other recent intrigues that threatened to fracture the realm. In essence, it was the same choice that every High Elf Aravian who becomes a Skinwalker must face: abject loss of freedom, or exile and even greater shame. Shocked, intimidated, and mindful of the negative consequences a refusal would have for her whole family, Gwyndolin felt she had no choice but to agree to the terms and leave everything behind.\r\n\r\nGwyndolin was trained in the necessary skills of subterfuge and combat, and trusted Skinwalker auxiliaries taught her how to best cope, adapt, and exploit her new body. She tried to remain stoic, and buried her lonely sorrow deep in her psyche, becoming cold, withdrawn, and taciturn. Her reticence of speech matched the incredible stealth her training and discipline enabled her to achieve, and Gwyndolin became known as the Silent. Her handlers gradually inured her to ever-greater danger and violence, escalating her missions from surveillance, to infiltration, to assassination. Wielding twinned talon-like blades, the only sounds she created in her missions were the slash and rip of fabric and flesh and the patter of spilled blood. Pitted often against the impoverished and oppressed, often fellow Skinwalkers, Gwyndolin hardened her heart and held her tongue. Her only solace was a feeling of martyrdom for her family’s sake, and hope of discovering the truth of her abduction.\r\n\r\nHer deployments against subversive non-Elves in Aravia have resulted in many minor successes, but no major progress in unmasking the forces behind the Winged Elves, the treachery of Elenaril, or, most infuriatingly for Gwyndolin, the true nature of her disappearance and transformation. With tempestuous war and upheaval sweeping across Anhelt, Gwyndolin is being pushed near to breaking point by her assignments. How long can Gwyndolin the Silent contain her sorrowful anger?",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8570#static": "One of the greatest Telerian commanders of the Second Great War, Androc the Glorious was renowned for his unyielding courage, inspiring charisma, and skill-at-arms. He ruled the Concord of Werinbur, an alliance of five wealthy cities situated in central Anhelt, along the meanders of the Leostead River.\r\n\r\nAndroc’s story begins with his saving of a Kaerok lion cub. The creature was abandoned and had a large thorn embedded deep in its paw. He removed the thorn and bore the mewling animal home, where he begged to be allowed to keep it. His father agreed, only if Androc took complete responsibility for the lion, which the boy had named Kitherus.\r\n\r\nThe cub and boy grew up together, each fiercely loyal and protective over the other. Androc became tall and strong, his body and mind hardened by the ceaseless hunting needed to keep Kitherus fed, earning respect from his peers and tutors. His confidence grew, and he became popular. Bandits feared to trifle with the prince and lion when they toured the land, which the people loved. They marveled at such a strange and strong bond between the two.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Second Great War began, Androc had earned his spurs and his first child had been born. He answered his father’s call to arms and Kitherus, full-grown, was at his side.\r\n\r\nAndroc achieved glory wherever he fought. At the Battle of Pharsine Pass, he led a charge of three thousand knights into the rear of the host of the Demonspawn Taaresh I’klick’si. Kitherus kept pace with Androc’s barded steed, and together they slammed into the unprepared foe. Both saved each other’s life in the chaos. When a Demonspawn threatened to hack into Androc’s flank with an ensorcelled ax, Kitherus ripped it apart. When some monster sought to leap upon the lion’s back to slit its throat, Androc caved in its head with his mace. The battle was truly won by Kitherus, who ripped off Taaresh’s serpentine head with his enormous claws and then crushed it between his canines. Androc became renowned for his devotion to his soldiers and to Lumaya, and was loved by all who fought beside him, whether they be Human or Orc, Elf or Ogryn.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Androc’s greatest, yet most tragic victory was at the Ending of the Saltmire Portal. There, wizards and shamans worked together to close a portal through which thousands of Undead and Demonspawn emerged. Amid thick marshes, warriors of Teleria fought the relentless onslaught. Wounded men and Elves drowned in pungent water as their comrades' corpses piled atop them. Ogryn sank to their necks in mud, their faces devoured by monsters while they were stuck. All cohesion among the forces of Light broke down, but they fought on, knowing they had to buy time for their magic-wielders. Androc and Kitherus were at the center, exhausted and caked in filth. Androc fought like a madman, swearing oaths to Lumaya and cursing as he drove shield and mace into the bodies and heads of his enemies. He was so consumed with fighting and surviving that he didn’t see Kitherus being overwhelmed by Undead horrors biting and tearing into his flesh. Hearing the lion’s pained roars, Androc finally saw what had befallen his companion and wailed as if his firstborn were dying before his eyes. Fury came over him. At battle’s end, Androc was coated head to foot in blood and Demonic ichor, him and Kitherus surrounded by mounds of enemy corpses. \r\n\r\nThe Arbiter saw it all. When the battle was finally won, she approached Androc as he crouched next to Kitherus’ near-lifeless form, face buried in the lion’s gore-matted fur. She praised them for their courage and faith, and helped Androc carry his dying companion out of the swamp. Then she blessed them, folding Kitherus’ fading spirit into the man’s armor and weapons, rendering beast and man as one. With a thought, Androc could now transform his heavy mace and shield into a long spear, which he called the Gildthorn in honor of the day he rescued Kitherus as a cub. He could also transform his helm so that it resembled a roaring lion’s visage. Through it, the lion’s spirit amplified Androc’s voice so that when he delivered a speech, bellowed orders, or roared war cries, they reverberated across the battlefield so all could hear.\r\n\r\nAndroc went on to win many more glorious victories. The sight of his unmistakable armor and the sound of his roar could rally the most hard-pressed forces or lead the most ferocious of Siroth’s warlords to consider withdrawing from the field. His retinue – known as the Knights of the Wild – each wore armor designed similarly to Androc’s, incorporating forms and motifs of powerful animals such as stallions, bears, or falcons. Their presence on the field was a stirring sight and a sign of surely impending Telerian victory.\r\n\r\nAndroc did not pass through the war unscathed. Months before its end, after over two decades, a scorpion-esque Demonspawn drove its stinger into his heart while he was defending wounded soldiers. Venom surged through his veins within seconds. Were it not for the Arbiter’s timely intervention to place Androc’s soul within a Shard, he would have suffered an agonizing death.\r\n\r\nFor all his courage and strength, Androc had neglected his family to fight the war. Not only did this make his sons resentful, but they and their successors for multiple generations greatly lacked Androc's skills. So deep was their spite, that they sought to besmirch Androc’s name, to improve their reputation by comparison. Over time, the notion of the Lionheart became tainted by the murderous hatred of Skinwalkers created during the Red Crusade. It was as if the venom that had laid Androc low infected his entire legacy. To this day, the Concord of Werinbur is a relative backwater of Kaerok, having fallen far short of its potential for centuries. Now, all that remains of Androc's glory are a handful of crumbling statues, and the lions depicted on the region’s tattered banners.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8580#static": "For many Banner Lords, the hunt is nothing more than a social event – an outdoor pageant to show off their bright white charger, slay some beast after a canter through their ancestral holdings, and then retire to the lodge for an evening’s entertainment. However, there are many for whom the visceral thrill of the hunt is the reward, rather than the suckling pig adorning the feasting table afterwards.\r\n\r\nOne hunting group of such Banner Lords is the Brotherhood of the Golden Horn. To gain entrance into this centuries-old covenant, a potential member must present the horn or claw of a great beast to prove their worth. No simple stag antler or bear claw will suffice – would-be Brothers must present an appendage of a creature at least twice their size, one whose roar could chill a hunter’s roiling blood.\r\n\r\nA hunter might have to range far and wide to find such a creature, and this is where Galfric, journeyman hunter and would-be Brother, found himself on an expedition to the sweltering Lost Isles of Teleria’s south. Galfric was on the trail of a flying, fire-breathing creature with red scales – a monster that had seemingly never been spotted in Teleria before. The great monster had been rumored to have emerged through a hole in reality itself in the forests of Kaerok, before taking flight southward. Wanting to finally prove himself, Galfric bought passage onto the first ship he could on the hunt for this monster from another world, only to find many of his fellow initiates had had the same notion.\r\n\r\nAs the ship sailed further south, one of the hunters aboard spotted a plume of smoke billowing from one of the islands. Convinced it was a sign of the monster, he demanded the captain sail toward it. When the ship drew close enough to the shore, Galfric leapt from the boat and raced ashore, plunging deep into the stifling undergrowth alone. Sweat dripped from his every pore as he hacked his way through the brush, following a trail of giant footsteps, claw marks, and upturned trees. But instead of finding his quarry, Galfric discovered something a little less shocking for him: a small talking cat, standing on its back legs and garbed in a remarkable set of hunting gear. It seemed to be surveying the tracks itself, scribbling down notes in a tiny notebook, and continuing further into the jungle. At first, Galfric considered this to be a mirage, the early symptom of some tropical disease. His confusion only increased when the cat spoke.\r\n\r\nWith great eloquence and confidence, the cat introduced itself as a Palico – a hunter’s assistant back in its own world, who accidentally traveled here from a world beyond Teleria. It had followed a trail of glowing flies from its world and had ended up finding something it called a Rathalos. Galfric listened intently, noting down the Palico’s wisdom and advice on how this Rathalos could be slain. While he understood the creature’s instructions, the Palico’s terrifying description of the beast – of its long claws, barbed tail, and flaming breath – made it clear his current, slightly rusted, broadsword would be no match for this monster. He asked if the Palico would follow him back to where the ship dropped anchor, as he reckoned that his fellow compatriots would by now have set up a camp there. The Palico agreed, and the two trekked through the jungle, sharing stories of hunts past.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived, Galfric implored the Palico to stay hidden, as one of the amateur trackers may see the hide of a talking feline as their way into the Brotherhood. Galfric ran to the expedition’s make-shift forge, imploring its smith to craft him a sword capable of piercing the hide of the magnificent monster the Palico had told him of. Seeing Galfric seemingly driven mad by the jungle heat, the smith asked no questions and set to work on Galfric’s request. After a night’s labor, the smith presented Galfric with the weapon he sought. The initiate returned quickly to his animal companion and the two set off, delving further into the island’s dense greenery, following a dancing trail of luminous green flies that the Palico assured would point the way to the Rathalos.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours, they were still searching. Galfric and the Palico eventually stumbled on what looked to be the tracks of others – different to those who traveled to the Lost Isles with Galfric, but obviously in pursuit of the monster. Not wanting to be beaten, Galfric and the Palico broke into a sprint, the thrill of the hunt energizing their weary muscles, as they leapt over branch and trunk. As they ran they could hear roars, cries, and the clash of blades in the distance – their quarry was near. And so was Galfric’s chance to become a legendary blademaster.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8590#static": "Before it was Yakai, before it was called the Dawnlands, the wilds of eastern Peltas were often referred to by another name – the Land of Beasts. Its landscapes provided ample home for all manner of creatures, from the shape-shifting kitsune to the mischievous fire-monkey and from the majestic star bear to the hungering grovewolf. While centuries of war and urbanization have disturbed much of its delicate ecosystem, the people of Yakai still attempt to live in harmony with their land’s original inhabitants where possible.\r\n\r\nThis attitude is displayed no more clearly than by the Moju. These trackers migrate alongside many of Yakai’s various species, seeking to protect them from poachers and unscrupulous hunters, and warn homesteads and farms that dangerous beasts may soon be upon them.\r\n\r\nBorn on one of the Moju’s many migration patrols, Haru was a gifted trapper. Her parents boasted that she made her first snare before she could walk, and that when she did, her tiny footfalls barely made a sound. A lucky boon as Haru never stayed still, constantly ranging beyond the limits of her clan’s patrol to observe the movements of beasts who had also strayed from the path. After spending her entire childhood on the move, Haru’s patrol eventually settled in a small hamlet on the winding Opal River – acting as guides to its growing community of farmers and fishermen.\r\n\r\nOn a routine survey on the edges of the hamlet’s farms, Haru noticed someone had meddled with her traps – each of their delicate mechanisms had been expertly disarmed. Looking closely, Haru noticed the telltale sign of claw marks. A canny Skinwalker? A Fae looking to taunt its would-be captor? After following the trail of disarmed traps, she caught a small figure looming over one in a shady grove. With her trademark guile and gripping her dual daggers, she tiptoed closer. What Haru saw was a cat standing on its hindlegs, tinkering with her creation.\r\n\r\nCuriosity overriding her fear, Haru hailed the creature. It yelped and spun to face its assailant. Haru introduced herself as the maker of the traps that this mysterious creature had been disarming. It praised Haru for her ingenuity, claiming that her traps were unlike anything it had seen made by the master hunters from its own world. Assuming it was a Fae, Haru scrambled into her pack for some small offering and plunged to the ground in a deep bow, hoping not to have her soul stolen by the creature’s gaze. The cat laughed, responding that it wasn’t some forest god or magical spirit, but a Palico – a being who was investigating traces of a monster from its own world: a Zinogre.\r\n\r\nWhile still not convinced that this wasn’t some elaborate game, Haru listened to the Palico’s words – it described a majestic creature that could channel lightning through its own body. Fearing that this monster may disturb the delicate animal migration paths, or turn its ire towards her hamlet, Haru offered to lend her blades to help the Palico. The creature told her that while sufficient for dealing with small animals, Haru’s blades and current array of traps would be no match for this monster. Haru’s blades did, however, mirror a weapon the Palico had seen many times on their adventures with hunters from their world. Struck by inspiration, it rooted around in its bag and pulled out a detailed tome gifted to them by their previous hunter, full of instructions on not only how to defeat such a beast, but suggestions of equipment needed to do so.\r\n\r\nHaru bundled the manual and the Palico in her arms and raced home, electrified by the thought of this grand challenge. She barged into the local forge, terrifying its elderly smith with tales of talking cats and monsters from another world. She presented the Palico’s manual to the smith and they set about the work, crafting for Haru a set of blades that could pierce the hide of her mysterious prey.\r\n\r\nAfter a restless night’s sleep, Haru and the Palico set out – following the ancient migration paths that Haru’s patrol had guarded for centuries. On their way, the two swapped stories of past hunts, and of magnificent creatures from their respective worlds. As they wound their way along the well-trodden routes, the pair found burnt branches, tree trunks cleft in twain, and heard a distant roar. They were getting closer.\r\n\r\nThe hunt that followed became immortalized in the Song of the Lightning Dancer by local lyricists – with them singing of Haru weaving through bolts of electricity and her blades glistening like the moon as she fought the monster. More dramatic retellings have the hunt taking place during a raging storm, with thunderbolts appearing with Zinogre’s earth-shaking roars. All that’s truly known about the battle is Haru’s victory – and the crackling armor and blades she now proudly sports.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8600#static": "Sayjida is one of the most experienced guides for those wishing to cross the Krokhan Desert and is well trusted by the many caravaneers who ferry supplies from the trade depots of the Valdemar Strait to the bustling bazaars of Velyzar. She is no stranger to monsters such as the ravenous stingmaw or the multi-fanged dunestalker – her first employment saw her transporting kegs of the finest Aravian pearl-plum wine through the man-eating ant-lion mounds of Howling Bluff, with nary a drop spilled.\r\n\r\nWith this experience, Sayjida could quickly assess whether tales of monsters were true, or if they were the results of overexcited traders, their minds dazed by the insufferable heat. But when several caravans all reported seeing giant spikes punched into the walls of a commonly traveled valley – Sayjida knew she had to investigate.\r\n\r\nWhen a convoy she was accompanying rested at an oasis located near the valley, Sayjida took her bow and explored it. Throughout the valley were, just as the rumors said, huge black spikes, driven into the red rockface of the valley’s walls. She couldn’t so much as score them with her knife. They were as hard as granite and rough to the touch. Curiosity didn’t usually pay, Sayjida knew, but she pressed further into the valley.\r\n\r\nAs Sayjida rounded a corner with an arrow notched, she encountered something she never expected. Surveying one of the spikes was a small feline creature, in a hunter’s outfit and furiously taking notes. It identified itself as a Palico, a hunter’s aid from another world who had traveled here from beyond Teleria.\r\n\r\nSayjida had barely begun to respond when an almighty bellow emanated from deeper within the valley. She didn’t need to be told twice – she quickly beckoned her new companion to follow her, and they sprinted out of the valley.\r\n\r\nOnce they were safe, Sayjida listened to the Palico’s tale. If this Ruiner Nergigante was not removed, it could roam further afield, bringing chaos to Velyzar’s vital trade routes, and severely damaging her bottom line. Sayjida offered to defeat this monster, and the Palico rejoiced, immediately presenting Sayjida with what looked like a journal, replete with notes from previous hunts that would be vital for defeating this foe.\r\n\r\nSayjida led the Palico back to her caravan’s stop-off point at the nearby oasis, and ensured her new friend was out of sight. Should one of the caravaneers spot the talking feline, they would cage it and it would be on its way to a Velyzari bazaar before sunrise. As the Palico slept, Sayjida labored in the desert moonlight, using whatever scraps she could steal from unguarded wagons for all manners of traps and alarms. That same night, she stole back into the Nergigante’s valley and rigged a gauntlet of traps that she hoped would at least tire the monster.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the pair journeyed back to the spiked valley, avoiding Sayjida’s tripwires, heading to where the two had first met. After an exchange of knowing nods, the two began to bellow and shout, as if they were trying to wake the entire Krokhan Desert. When the ear-splitting roar of the Nergigante joined the choir, they may even have been successful.\r\n\r\nIt was a monster unlike anything she’d ever seen. Bristling with six-foot long black spikes, it emanated a primal anger – one hardened by years of strife. The giant, furious beast barreled towards Sayjida and the Palico, unfurling its spiked wings and readying to smash them with its jet-black horns. The pair sprinted for their lives, a hail of spikes following them in their desperate flight. The Nergigante charged through each of Sayjida’s traps, none of them slowing it. Rocks fell from the valley’s side, triggered by Sayjida’s tripwires, and the Nergigante jumped over them effortlessly. Bolas burst from the ground to tie the beast’s legs, but its spikes cut through the rope before they could find their mark. The chase spilled out into the open plain, where Sayjida finally spun round to face her pursuer.\r\n\r\nSayjida unleashed a hail of arrows – spikes of her own – at the monster.\r\n\r\nArrows and spikes are said to have littered the valley after the hunt. Caravans soon resumed traveling through the valley, their way marked by curious spires of black rock, which many swore were bone. Sayjida returned to her duties, now clad in armor studded with part of those self-same spikes, and wielding a fearsome bow to match.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8610#static": "The promise of immortality does not mean much to a Drake or a boulderworm. To bring them into the service of the Cult of K’Leth requires a different form of persuasion – administered by the end of a blade or the crack of a whip. Such is the duty of the Cult’s beastdrivers, who range across Teleria looking to track, capture and, if things go wrong, hunt its creatures.\r\n\r\nHadrux was one such beastdriver, being tasked with pillaging the Nomad animal trains that wound their way down from the Deadlands and across the Krokhan Desert. Other less-talented beastdrivers had botched their attempts at raiding these convoys previously, resulting in lightly armed guards being replaced with highly trained Lizardmen mercenaries. While confident in his abilities, Hadrux needed to pick his moment carefully. He sat in his Deadlands hunting hide, hoping for a stray wagon or lost traveler.\r\n\r\nFor days, the wagon trains trundled by and Hadrux watched his quarries rumble away. But on his fifth day of observation, he noticed a change. The panicked whispering of the wagon drivers, the closed formation of the guards, and an ominous glow in the sky. In the far distance, the long-quiet Thundermount rumbled, fire arcing from its gaping maw while lightning lashed its peak. With both wagon drivers and guards jumpy and eager to leave the vicinity of the volcano, their disarray presented an opportunity to strike. Hadrux gathered his equipment and turned to leave. He was interrupted by a small figure, peeling open his hide’s flap.\r\n\r\nIt was a bipedal cat, garbed in hunting attire and clutching some paper in its hands. It talked of the need to deal with an otherworldly creature that had appeared on the nearby volcano, and had the potential to unleash a full-scale eruption. The cat poked at the slip of paper in its hand, pleading for Hadrux’s aid. The beastdriver, after recovering from his bewilderment, crouched down to calm the feline. He took the paper and inspected the cat’s erratic handwriting and hastily-drawn doodles. It showed how close an eruption was to happening and the potential movements of this mysterious monster. Scrawled at the bottom was its name: Alatreon. Hadrux had his new quarry, something far greater than the livestock herded by the Nomads.\r\n\r\nHadrux grabbed his most trusted and powerful piece of equipment, a hunting scythe considered the most formidable in all of Teleria, thrust the note into his pocket, and prepared to leave the hide. The cat, calling itself a Palico, asked if it could assist. Hadrux refused – hunts were best handled alone and if this Alatreon was as dangerous as this tiny creature claimed, a distraction would prove fatal. After Hadrux left, the Palico’s cautions followed him for a while, until they faded into the howling winds of the Deadlands. With the now roused mountain as his guide, Hadrux trudged through the unforgiving wastes, thinking of the glory that would be his, should he manage to drag this monster from another world back to his masters.\r\n\r\nHadrux eventually reached the base of the Thundermount, its slopes now blanketed with a bizarre mix of snow and ash, something that should be all but impossible. Storm clouds wheeled overhead, lit by forks of lightning, and lava flows bubbled down from the mountain’s apex. As Hadrux continued up the mountain, this elemental storm grew fiercer. If nothing else, Hadrux could take solace that he’d lived a life long enough to encounter something capable of causing such upheaval.\r\n\r\nHadrux soon spotted his prey on an island within a lava flow. Wreathed in frost and fire, the Alatreon saw Hadrux in turn and rent the sky with a roar. Before Hadrux could even draw his scythe, the monster took flight, and rained jets of flame toward him. It darted through the sky at terrifying speed, practically toying with Hadrux as the Knight Revenant dodged between its fiery blasts. He had to get down the mountain and to solid ground – one wrong step navigating the lava flows and he’d be consumed by its molten grasp.\r\n\r\nAs Hadrux leapt over the flows, the Alatreon peeled off from its pursuit and flew down toward the volcano’s base. Confused at being given this reprieve, Hadrux looked around, and spotted a small figure in the distance – the Palico – attracting the monster’s attention by desperately jumping around and meowing. This gave Hadrux the time he needed to descend the volcano’s slopes. He exchanged a knowing glance with his savior before unsheathing his scythe. He fell upon the Alatreon like a bladed cyclone, and the two clashed among the lava bubbling down from the Thundermount with lightning striking all around.\r\n\r\nHadrux never returned to the Knights Revenant, and his fellow beastdrivers never found any remnants of him. In their wanderings of the Deadlands, all they reported were sightings of a black-suited figure, wielding a dreadful scythe that crackled with unstable-looking energy.",
    "l10n:hero-type/bio?id=8620#static": "The Dark Elf Frizen had only ever truly known the company of beasts. He never knew his mother and his father was a distant parent, teaching his son the basics of hunting and foraging, before venturing into the darkest bramble on one stalk and never returning. Frizen instead learned from Durham Forest’s creatures, studying their behavior. From them, he learned how to hunt through the undergrowth, climb the forest’s highest trees, and silently fall upon his prey. By the time he reached adulthood, he was more beast than person, attuned to the chaotic rhythms of Durham.\r\n\r\nFrizen was by no means feral, however. He traded with caravans that passed through Durham’s far reaches, exchanging sturdy insect carapaces and knowledge of the forest’s creatures for food and hunting tools. Tales of the solitary ‘beast-Elf’ spread along the tracks and trails weaving through Durham, with his tattered bag of animal parts and his broadsword strapped to his back.\r\n\r\nIt was many years after his father’s death when Frizen noticed some disquiet among the forest’s creatures. Many had moved from their usual stomping grounds, displaced by something. He noticed myriad footprints all running deeper into the forest, all fleeing from some invasive terror which left much larger indentations. It took the discovery of a beast he had never seen before in one of his net-traps that all but confirmed his suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt was a small, cat-like creature, dressed up in garb that looked like that of a Human huntsman. As Frizen cut it free from his net, it remarked on the expert construction of the trap, commenting that it was unlike anything they had seen in its world. Confused but equally intrigued by this talking feline, Frizen warned it not to linger in the forest too long. Not only were its creatures troubled and primed to lash out, but any Ranger worth their salt would have this cat bagged and sold into a menagerie of other fantastic beasts before nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe cat said that the disquiet in the forest was its reason for ranging so far. It formally introduced itself as a Palico – a hunter’s aide from another world, who was on the trail of one of its world’s most formidable monsters, the dreadful Fatalis. It told Frizen the legends surrounding this black, winged beast – including how it once brought an entire kingdom to ruin in a single night. From its bag, the Palico revealed sketches of the monster and behavioral notes gathered from legends and folklore, and said that if it wasn’t dealt with quickly, it could cause monumental destruction.\r\n\r\nChaotic as the forest was, it was a stable chaos. If permitted to range freely, a beast of the Fatalis’s size and power would undoubtedly disturb Durham’s delicate equilibrium, even drawing out the primeval monsters from the forest’s heart. Should that happen, no-one would be safe. Frizen agreed to accept help from the Palico, and escorted it back to its camp to plan a strategy.\r\n\r\nThe two labored for hours, swapping tactics and ensuring they were prepared for every eventuality. With trepidation in his heart, Frizen and his new companion began following the Fatalis’s trail, hoping it had not raised the ire of Durham’s ancient rulers.\r\n\r\nLuckily for the two hunters, the Fatalis had peeled off from its incursion into the forest’s depths, instead establishing itself in a long-ruined castle on the fringe of the woodland. There, it loomed over crumbling parapets and turrets, its imposing aura weighing down the very air. The hunters entered the remains of the castle courtyard, which the monster now ruled. Taking a deep breath, Frizen drew his blade and locked eyes with the Fatalis. Its eyes pierced through his very being. It seemed to snort in amusement, before unfurling its wings and roaring. The ground shook and masonry cracked and crumbled. Frizen did not waver and instead approached the beast, knuckles white around the hilt of his sword.\r\n\r\nThe battle is said to have lasted all night, with reports from one nearby canopy-town speaking of humongous jets of flame bursting from the castle’s highest turret. More fanciful story-tellers claim to have seen a Dark Elf briefly riding a black dragon with blade held high, before both plunged to the ground in a breakneck dive. The only constant is that a haggard Dark Elf eventually emerged from the castle, battered and broken but accompanied by what some say was a clothed, bipedal cat.\r\n\r\nFrizen eventually returned to his hunting duties, but no longer with his tattered bag and broadsword. He was now clad in armor as black as night, wielding a two-handed monstrosity of a blade – one that could cleave the hide of the toughest rockworm in one strike. Tales of the beast-Elf soon faded from memory, and all that remained was tales of Frizen of the Black Scale.",
